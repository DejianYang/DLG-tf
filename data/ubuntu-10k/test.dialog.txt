i set up my hd such that i have to type a passphrase to access it at boot . how can i remove that passwrd , and just boot up normal . i did this at install , it works fine , just tired of having reboots where i need to be at terminal to type passwd in . help ? __eou__ </d> backup your data , and re-install without encryption " might " be the easiest method __eou__ </d> so you dont know , ok , anyone else ? __eou__ you are like , yah my mouse doesnt work , reinstall your os lolol what a joke __eou__
im trying to use ubuntu on my macbook pro retina __eou__ i read in the forums that ubuntu has a apple version now ? __eou__ </d> not that ive ever heard of .. normal ubutnu should work on an intel based mac . there is the PPC version also . __eou__ you want total control ? or what are you wanting exactly ? __eou__ </d> just wondering how it runs __eou__
no suggestions ? __eou__ links ? __eou__ how can i remove luks passphrase at boot . i dont want to use feature anymore ... __eou__ </d> you may need to create a new volume __eou__ </d> that leads me to the next question lol ... i dont know how to create new volumes exactly in cmdline , usually i use a gui . im just trying to access this server via usb loaded with next os im going to load , the luks pw is stopping me __eou__ </d> for something like that I would likely use something like a live gparted disk to avoid the conflict of editing from the disk __eou__ </d> you cant load anything via usb or cd when luks is running __eou__ it wont allow usb boot , i tried with 2 diff usb drives __eou__

I know I'm probably doing something stupid here , but I can't figure out how to install ubuntu to sdb . All the installer shows is sda . gparted can see sdb __eou__ Any ideas ? __eou__ </d> use the ' somthign <unk> ' option and make your partitions on sdb as you want . ie : sdb1 = / sdb2 = /home/ sdb3 = swap . __eou__ </d> Yeah when I choose " something else " I'm not seeing sdb in there either . I'm not sure why __eou__ </d> You can partion the HD with gparted from the live cd , then start the installer .. perhaps . __eou__ thats how i tend to do it . __eou__ The installers partion manager tool is a bit . annoying . __eou__ I also noticed the installer did not have a ' Install to a specific drive using the whold drive ' option .. __eou__ sort of annoying it will automate other things .. but not a fairly common case of a Seperate HD Just for linux . __eou__

how do I create a folder from the command line ? __eou__ <unk> , how do I restart a process ? kill and start ? or is it easier ? :P __eou__ </d> depends on the process ... who is it owned by ? is it a system service ? __eou__ </d> nautilus __eou__ it seems to randomly lock up , so I was going to assign a keyboard shortcut to restart it , only to find out I don't know how to restart a process , or if it 's even possible ... __eou__ </d> Use the " kill " command to send processes signals telling them to exit . You need the process id to use " kill " e.g. kill -TERM 1234 . You can also use " killall < <unk> > " e.g. killall nautilus __eou__ </d> so there 's no restart ? __eou__

okay davidrsmorris give me a few minutse __eou__ minutes* __eou__ one quick thing ... I assume the laptop is 32 bit , am I correct ? __eou__ davidrsmorris __eou__ </d> When the liveCD starts your get to a menu with " try Ubuntu ..." etc ... at the bottom of the screen are some prompts for function keys . Pressing F6 will allow you to remove the " quiet splash " boot options to see messages as the PC boots ... which should allow us to figure out what is going wrong . See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Changing_the_CD_Boot_Option_Configuration_Line __eou__ </d> What I just did was on that menu I clicked Install UBUNTU .. Which I have never seen before . So know it is working and I think I may have some progress .... davidrsmorris __eou__ </d> There might be a CD read error ... removing " quiet splash " will show if the kernel reports failed reads __eou__ If you can see the kernel 's messages as it boots you might get a clue as to the cause of the problem . Otherwise it 's just stabs in the dark __eou__ I've known often of CD drives with dislodged dust stopping the laser from focusing correctly ... showing read errors ... and fixed by giving the drive slot a very strong <unk> ! __eou__ whilst its going ... don't tempt fate and stop it :p __eou__ That sounds sensible . Often the hardest part is the CD/DVD based installation . __eou__ That sounds good . Often we underestimate how long a CD-based boot will take __eou__ As long as you have the desktop you have a user session . If the mouse fails you can still get to a text terminal and run diagnostics/check log files for clues __eou__ I've known it take 5 minutes on slow systems/CD drives ... go get a coffee and come back :p __eou__ You'll be 15 by the time its done :p __eou__ Congratulations on seeing the light :D __eou__ Is the mouse responding ... what kind of mouse device does the laptop have ? touchpad ? usb external mouse ? __eou__ </d> It responds now , and it is touchpad __eou__ </d> Slow but steady progess then __eou__ useful information : most Linux 's in multiuser mode start several terminals ( ttys ) and run the GUI on tty7 or tty8 ... You can get to those other ( text ) terminals from the GUI by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 ... F7 ... and you can return to the GUI by pressing Alt+F7 or F8 __eou__ </d> LOL I have no idea what you just said __eou__ </d> You can use those terminals to diagnose problems and view system boot messages when you have serious problems that prevent GUI use __eou__ </d> Is there a cheat sheet for this ? Lol because I can't remember shortcuts easily . __eou__
hello __eou__ I need some support , anybody there ? __eou__ </d> go ahead with your questions . Introductions are not expected on irc . __eou__ </d> I have an HP Pavilion ze4600 here and I can't get it to install ubuntu __eou__ </d> will it boot the livecd ? __eou__ yes , if it was the approximately 700 mb image . __eou__ </d> I don't know what liveCD is . Is that just the 32 bit cd I burned to the disc ? __eou__ </d> are you on IRC on a separate machine ? Are you running Ubuntu from the disk ? __eou__ </d> I am on a seperate laptop , and I have the problematic laptop next to me __eou__ yes I booted from the disk __eou__ </d> Do you hear the disk moving when the purple screen ( boot splash ) comes on ? Do you hear it either stop or keep going at the same speed when it starts just staying ? __eou__ I think it 's stumped . Try turning it off , and then when you see the purple screen , press Escape . It should hopefully turn into a black background and start giving out lines of text . When it gets stuck again , tell us what the line of text at the bottom of the screen is . __eou__ </d> are you there ? __eou__ </d> The 32bit CD is right for your machine if it got you to the splash . __eou__ You probably want to try ubuntu first . And that menu should have a " check cd for errors " option which you should use . __eou__ Not all of the text is important . The text is describing what is happening as the computer starts up . The part that 's important is the last thing done before something went wrong and it hung . __eou__ </d> TJ- What I am going to do is watch the text advance until it stops . I am seeing it stopping and starting many things . This looks normal . __eou__ </d> yep , and if you're quick , you'll begin to learn a little about all the software that turns arithmetic into a grahical interface . __eou__

ThinkT510 : tnx __eou__ W4sp : for some odd reason many systems i put ubuntu on got this corrupted square mouse pointer at first boot , after a reboot it dissapears __eou__ something like this : https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-ati/+question/144040 __eou__ ! cn | kk_ __eou__ W4sp : im just reading alot of websites saying that enabling swcursor : true would fix this mouse problem ... im not trying to mess with xorg if i dont need __eou__ </d> Once root has done it edit your copy of xorg . conf . auto as desired ( <unk> issue ) and what else you've got . When you have finished editing it put in ton /etc/X11/ as xorg . conf . Make sure file permission is rw for root and r for group and others . __eou__ The reason for my suggestion is that Xorg runs configuration settings during runtime and automatically , As you are not satisfied with this you need to averride the settings manually with your wcursre requirements . Auto-generating xorg . conf will not address your issue as it is the same as the autogenerated settings . __eou__ </d> im not sure im gonna mess with xorg yet , im more interested in understanding why ubuntu boots this cursor problem once a day .. __eou__ </d> Further , if you have not done soe make yourself familiar with methods to boot into CLI mode . __eou__ Sure , it is your decision as you are the root admin . __eou__
hey guys , how can I add an extra xsession to ubuntu 10.04 ? __eou__ that is , I dont want GNOME __eou__ </d> try this : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CustomXSession __eou__ </d> ill take a look , thanks __eou__
that message is OK . It is telling you that it has loaded drift frequency data from the file <unk> . drift __eou__ </d> i think that that file may be corrupted ... i had big trouble the last two weeks , because my system time always shifted off - with and without ntp __eou__ would a purge and reinstall fo ntp be a safe solution ? __eou__ in case the time shifts off again __eou__ </d> ntp re-install won't fix things . If your computer is always on ( or is on more than it is off) , you need NTP server installed to keep time synced to a reliable time source . This is because of drift , and the fact that ntpdate only changes the clock on boot __eou__
a local custom repository .

hello , how can i copy a file from a remote host __eou__ </d> If you have SSH access you can use scp or sftp __eou__ </d> scp don't work for me he don't found the host __eou__ can i use pastebin or some thing like that __eou__ </d> well to gain access to another host the name must resolve using DNS , the host must be running the ssh server , and the firewalls must allow access __eou__ </d> how will you write the command when the user on a windows domain __eou__ </d> If the system holding the file is Windows , you can't usually use SSH ( scp/sftp ) unless that server had an SSH server installed . You'll have to find another way ... probably using a Windows Share on the server and samba on the Ubuntu PC __eou__ </d> i can shh to the machine , that 's not the problem __eou__ </d> if you can ssh you should be able to scp too ! __eou__

the main problem with live migration is changing data . How are you going to add that data to a new filesystem while also keeping it in sync with the old one ? It just can't be done . Best you can do is a freeze on the current FS which will allow read but refuse writes , then copy it over , remount new one over old one and continue . Do note , that depending on the amount of data there will be a long time of freeze where no new data can be wr __eou__ <unk> . __eou__ </d> not sure how sun did it , but they did live migration for zfs __eou__ ufs->zfs __eou__ </d> initial googling shows that ZFS is an upgrade of UFS , so they only added a few things to it .

Getting weird permission denied messages when I'm trying to run certain scripts if they have errors in them . IF I just run the script , it returns " bash : <unk> : Permission denied ", but if I call it with bash it shows me the actual error __eou__ It seems like some sort of environment problem or something , but I'm not sure where to look to fix it . __eou__ This happens when running things as root or as a normal user __eou__ </d> are the scripts marked as executable ? __eou__ </d> yup __eou__ If I comment out the portions of the scripts that are breaking , they run fine __eou__

Hi . I am installing ubuntu now in my new laptop . In " something else " partitioning , what mount point should I set for a drive which is not root or not home ... __eou__ </d> It 's up to you , just choose a directory that will remind you of the contents of that partition . E.G. : if it 's the Windows partition , use /windows . __eou__ </d> it 's a new harddrive with full free space . I bought it without windows preinstalled . __eou__ I want to create drives in which I will only store files .. I mean , not root or not home . What mount point do I set for it ? " /mount " is not shown in drop down menu __eou__ sorry . I mean /mount __eou__ I mean , in my desktop , extra drives are mounted in /media __eou__ do you understand my problem ? Sorry , English is not my native language . __eou__ </d> I do :) Just use a directory with a meaningful name and preferably in the root , for example " /files ". __eou__ Choose something like " /files ". __eou__ </d> / for root , /home for home , but what mount point for a file storage partition . __eou__ wait , let me see if there is a " /files " , thank you . __eou__ </d> If it does not exist , just create it . __eou__
Guys , I have an issue with Backtrack 5 that is based on Ubuntu 10.04 . 4 LTS . How should I gracefully set GDM to run after startup in latest BT 5 ?

does the script rely on some environment variables being set , that aren't now ? best way to find out is add " set -x " as the 2nd or 3rd line of the file so it shows every command __eou__ </d> I've tried doing that sort of thing , but everything seems to be getting set right . I first ran into this issue with ec2-cmd tool . It started giving me this permission denied thing out of the blue ( as far as I can tell ) but after digging in , it'd not able to load some jars it requires even though the classpath is right . __eou__ the latest problem is trying to build redis from source , where it 's giving me the " permission denied " when trying to run make . __eou__ </d> I recall having stumbled on the same thing several years ago ; turned out to be an env variable with the wrong value __eou__ is that the package ' redis ' or a source tarball ? __eou__ </d> I need a particular version so I'm building it from the tarball from redis . io __eou__ </d> I've just cloned the redis git repository ; I'll try that __eou__ </d> Works fine on all my servers , but on my workstation it chokes , and I suspect it 's the same thing that caused my ec2-cmd to break __eou__ </d> can you pastebin the output of " env " AFTER you've randomised any sensitive values in their ? __eou__ </d> correction to the above , the permission denied message gets triggered when trying to run . /configure for jemalloc dep in redis __eou__ </d> have you looked at the config . log that it created ? __eou__ A good step in these situations is to create another user account and use that since it shouldn't be tainted by any of your shell or environment customisations __eou__ </d> Yeah , that 's how I discovered it was the same permission denied thing , it was in the config . log __eou__ good idea , I'll give that a shot . __eou__ </d> configure often tries to run with a minimal set of ENV vars __eou__ one other thing that can catch you out like this : if the files it is trying to execute are on a file-system with the noexec option set __eou__ </d> This started at some point after moving my homedir onto a different device and mounting it under /home . I'm not sure if it correlates exactly , but that is the only change I can think of that might be relevant , but everything else seems happy __eou__ </d> like USB flash devices __eou__ check the mount options I reckon __eou__ </d> that 's an interesting idea __eou__ </d> nice one __eou__ </d> goos thinking , thanks for talking through with me __eou__ I doubt I would have thought of that any time soon __eou__

Clip2net is not running on 64-bit system http://clip2net.com/en/ Anyone else on 64-bit could perhaps test this ? Its a simple bin file . chmod +x followed by . /filename . bin usually starts the installer __eou__ What are the advantages of running 64-bit system ? I hear with PAE one can have available up to 64gb of RAM on a 32-bit system . __eou__ </d> Many operations are faster with 64 bit instructions than with 32 bit instructions , also with PAE an individual application can still only access 3 GiB ( which for most Desktop apps is more than enough) . __eou__ </d> can't think of an app which requires more than 3gb ram . I only have 8gb ram anyway . I hear some things even run slower on 64 , so , does that balance out ? Pros and Cons ... but __eou__ </d> Flash is native 64 bit now . __eou__ </d> I was going to add ... the 32 vs 64 has people divided __eou__

I've just reinstalled and setup Ubuntu 12.04 on new hardware , all things look good . The new hardware has UEFI boot and it seem to boot faster with this so I want it on . I have another operating system installed on another drive/partition which I could boot from GRUB2 on my old hardware which did not have UEFI . update-grub finds the other bootable partition and makes a menu entry for it , but it will not boot ... complaining about UEFI something . I __eou__ s it possible to boot old BIOS bootable partitions using GRUB2 on UEFI ? __eou__ </d> I know nothing about UEFI , but here is a wiki to check out while you are waiting . https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting#UEFI%20Shell __eou__ Are signed up with the ubuntu forums as well ? __eou__ </d> yup __eou__
I'm looking at the link you gave , I'll try to help you although you probably know more than me , __eou__ </d> thanks __eou__ </d> I'm not sure , but maybe the instructions in the link you gave are for gnome2 and gnome3 has more configuration files for the background ( even if you use unity it 's still only a shell over gnome3 ) __eou__ maybe while chrooted try something like this : https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=933248 __eou__ </d> I am working on a xubuntu iso so I have xfce to play with __eou__ </d> ahhhhh right i forgot __eou__ did you find a link explaining to change the default xfce background ?

What I think is that the problem is the package for the xfce installer has it 's own settings for <unk> , but I'm not sure what is the name of the installer . __eou__
Hello __eou__ Good day ? __eou__ could any one help me please ? __eou__ </d> Just state your question , if someone knows the answer he will respond __eou__ It should work out of the box - if not , there are generally simple steps to perform ( and I'll try to help you) . Do you know its make and model ? __eou__ </d> it 's Broadcom 802.11 <unk> __eou__ </d> Could you open a terminal and type " sudo lshw ", then paste the output in a pastebin ? __eou__ OK , run this specific command : " lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4 ". What I need are ( 1 ) the precise card model ( it should look like " <unk> " ) and the PCI ID of the card ( should look like " [ 14e4 : <unk> " ) . ( xxxx are letters and/or numbers) . __eou__ Have you access on a second computer near you ? It would be extremely useful to chat on one system and try to solve the problem on the one you are currently on . __eou__ Otherwise , I can just tell you if your card is supported or not and give you the steps to solve the problem , but I won't be able to help in case it does not work __eou__ Just a minute , I'll search if there 's another way to check the model without rebooting to Ubuntu __eou__ OK , to get the hardware ID open Computer Management , then open the Device Manager , right-click on your wireless card and choose Properties , in the Advanced tab there should be a dropdown list , choose " Hardware ID " from that and copy and paste the contents displayed below ( I'm going from memory , might not be 100% accurate ) __eou__
I just want to know the mount point in " create new partition " window . __eou__ </d> The mount point is up to you to choose . __eou__ It can be /home/archana/videos or /home/achana/pictures or .... __eou__ So you first create the directory . mkdir ~/Files __eou__ You create a new directory for it , and then make the entry in the /etc/fstab file that indicates that the partition be mounted there in that [ new ] directory . __eou__ Wow , you are doing an install . I thought you were working on an existing system . Sorry for irrelevant information .... __eou__ </d> new laptop , bought without windows preinstalled . __eou__ </d> Awesome ! __eou__ </d> It has full unpartitioned space of 750 gb .. Now I want to create " partition 1 , partition 2 , extended partition which will have root , home " __eou__ I want that partition 1 outside for installing windows at a later time if there is a need . Now I wish to know what to choose as mount point for that ? __eou__ sorry , but do you understand my English ? :( __eou__ </d> Well , you're gonna want a small swap , a larger / partition , and the rest for /home ( the / partition can be 20 or 30M maybe even less) . __eou__ Well , you're gonna want a small swap , a larger / partition , and the rest for /home ( the / partition can be 20 or 30G maybe even less) . __eou__ I would say go with about 4G for swap , 40G for / and the rest for /home __eou__ </d> I know all that , thanks . But I just need to know what mount point to give for a drive which is a separate drive , not in root , home , swap list . __eou__

Hello all ! I just installed ' eterm ' using ' sudo aptitude install eterm ' Looked like something was installed but when I run ' eterm ' in the command line , ' eterm ' cannot be found !! Do I have to do a restart or something ?! __eou__ </d> in order to do that you should have something called eterm on one of the directories when you type echo $PATH __eou__ </d> I looked in /usr/bin/ but it was not there . It did install as it gave me the yes/no prompt with eterm as the name of the package that was about to be installed . __eou__ </d> maybe it 's installed but you just don't have anything in your path , if you find where it has been installed you'll just have to create a symlink to it in one of your PATH folder I guess __eou__

@usr yes but the is a command with sudo before it runs sudo /sbin/ifconfig __eou__ @spirit3 i need sudo because the rights __eou__ if i run it with out nothing will happen __eou__ </d> just pastebin your script please __eou__ care to paste your script ? __eou__ works fine for me , shows standard ifconfig output __eou__ it also works without sudo in there for me __eou__ after following W4sp 's suggestion , the /sbin/ifconfig in the script will run the same as when run ' by hand ' ( if run by the same user ) __eou__ can you show us the terminal output for that ... from nothing through both runs to a blank prompt __eou__ pastebin dude ... and we need everything , a complete copy and paste of your terminal session __eou__ seriously , drop the sudo __eou__ using -a is fine , but the sudo is unneeded __eou__ </d> i will using it with -a and don't run it with sudo thanks __eou__
are they on the same subnet ? __eou__ are you using a switch ? __eou__ could be the collision domains __eou__ thats what I thought __eou__ are you using RIP or static routes ? __eou__ once all the devices have pinged each other they should cache the arp __eou__ can't you just run the script as root ? __eou__ have you checked the arp tables ? __eou__ I would be using atleast 2-3 vlans if I was you __eou__ with 6 hosts __eou__ </d> Wasting 3 VLANs for 6 vms - is suboptimal . __eou__ </d> well when you have a cisco switch .. __eou__ </d> Even a cisco router wont turn that pointless idea into something good :) __eou__ </d> why wouldn't you want less broadcast domains ? __eou__ just run the script as root __eou__ </d> Because 6 hosts are almost nothing , in terms of broadcast domains . So there is no need to put every vm into a vlan just to reduce broadcasts . __eou__ Thats pointless . __eou__
only the first time , anytime after that for 5 minutes will not prompt for password __eou__ </d> Right , but at some point , a password needs to be supplied , so using sudo in a script is a problem __eou__ </d> using sudo to run ifconfig is pointless in itself __eou__

Googlefu has failed me , Have a Logitech M185 Bluetooth mouse that I would like to pair with my intigrated Bluetooth . I am running Ubuntu 12.04 . Any suggestions on where to start ?

try without any xorg . conf in the another system __eou__ </d> not sure what you mean __eou__ </d> just read what W4sp said __eou__ there is a way to change the monitor resolution . Just put " resolution " or " displays " in Unity __eou__ </d> I got to the displays icon , click it and I see ' Laptop ' and the resolution reads ' 800x600 ' and that 's it , no other choices .... __eou__ </d> are you sure the drivers for your gpu are loaded correctly ? If yes , then I think there is no other way than this : http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-change-display-resolution-settings-using-xrandr.html __eou__ </d> here 's a pastebin for xrandr : http://pastebin.com/EcNWF5AS __eou__
YOu would need to create a new xorg . conf file and check the difference . Also , xorg . conf is not mandatory and the X server should do perfectly without . Use xorg . conf if something isn't right . Do not use xorg . conf from other systems as they may have different hardware . Use diff to compare . __eou__ </d> I understand the hardware may be different . That 's why I included the note " reconfigured my xorg . conf ... " to match the hardware on the new ( other , copied to ) system __eou__ </d> I noticed it some time ago when you posted it the first time . __eou__
It 's probably down to a dbus error . Did you install anything prior the error occured ? Also , does dmesg tell you anything ? __eou__ Well it 's probably down to dbus then . __eou__ What version do you have ? Did you mention it ? __eou__ We may need to check syslog , they rotate hence you may not find it in the current one . __eou__ The erro message is rather generic and can have different root causes . :-( __eou__ </d> so what logs should I produce to troubleshoot this ? __eou__ </d> syslog is already there . Sorry . You can find syslog* in /var/log . Search for the first occurence of the error and scroll up to see if there is anything suspicious . As said , it may be a dbus error and that would mean I cannot assist further as it is not in my league . __eou__ Do you have sound and all that jazz working ? __eou__ </d> I will at syslog again -- but I do believe that is the 1st sign of an error . __eou__ Yes - but only after the system is fully booted up and I have started a sound app ( such as pavucontrol ) __eou__
I have remote desktop set up on an Ubuntu 12.04 box , but after reboot I can't log in - I can get in via SSH . Does logging in with TIghtVNC require a full X session to already be open ?

It can have its own custom ' hidden ' desktop __eou__ </d> gotcha , thank you ! __eou__

Hi , I re installed ubuntu 12.04 because I upgraded my motherboard , processor and video card . However my /home is on another partition so I got to keep that . However , now when I log in to my old user account I get 1440x900 instead of 1650x1080 . Once I am logged in I can change it to that but it resets everytime . I created a new account and tested it , no problem it went right to the correct resolution . Any idea what file is causing this i __eou__ ssue ? __eou__ That is called displays now . __eou__ I have tried all sorts of things . I just found . compiz and . <unk> directories so I deleted them and will try that __eou__ I was just trying it according to an error in . <unk> : I/O warning : failed to load external entity " <unk> . <unk> " __eou__ </d> you could just make some backup dir and move all your various . * type configs over - till you find the one that does it . ;) __eou__ </d> I will give that a try __eou__ </d> or compare whats in the new users dir with the problem users .. see what files exist in the problem users .. __eou__ If you dont specifically uise the displays tool .. it should use the system default . so finding the config file and removeing it should tell it to use the defaults __eou__ possible location . <unk> __eou__
There is something in . config that is causing a prob for sure I moved that dir and it works , now i just have to narrow it down __eou__ </d> ~/ . <unk> . xml __eou__ </d> there is def a reference to 1440x900 in that xml file . Idk why a grep never turned it up when I search for 1440 __eou__

As you said the DVD is already ejected . There 's a lock for Nautilus that 's read by Nautilus not relased . ;-) __eou__ </d> so what 's the solution ? __eou__ </d> Check with mount what 's actually mounted . Nautilus may be a display issue that will disappear after reboot . __eou__ Fair enough . What does mount say ? Is it mounted or not . __eou__ Kill nauitlus and start it again with ' nautilus -c'. __eou__ </d> what 's the -c for ? __eou__ checks are taking a while __eou__ </d> That 's taking some time . Nautilus runs some self check . __eou__ </d> yeah , still checking it is .. __eou__ </d> Did you kill nautilus adn then started it again with -c ? __eou__ I mean , did you start N . from the terminal with the parameter ? __eou__ </d> yeah __eou__ </d> OK , Cool then . __eou__ </d> it was definitely hanging on something .. probably the sr0 error we are trying tos olve __eou__ I ran nautilus again without -c and the same phantom volume shows up in devices __eou__ </d> I think so too . It 's a good thing as it is an issue with nautilus , not with the fstabs __eou__ I'm back . Got a call . __eou__ Do you have root access to the box ? __eou__ </d> of course __eou__ </d> I needed to answer a call . We nned to kill a process that requires root access . I assume you are familiar with it . Find the process ID of gvfs-gdu-volume ( sudo ps -e | grep <unk> , then kill it with ' sudo kill -9 < the PID> . __eou__ If you run nautilus again with no command line parameters the volume should have gone . __eou__ When ? __eou__ </d> maybe itw orked __eou__ it also got rid of the automounted external hd's.. should i do sudo mount -a again ? __eou__ </d> OK , if you repeat the ps -e command it should be gone , just start nautilus and see if the volume isn't there . __eou__ No , the volumes are still there . It 's N . that 's causing confusion . __eou__ You can check with mount if that 's correct . __eou__ </d> I put a blank dvd in , and it won't mount or load auto on N __eou__ </d> What does mount say ? Is your DVD mounted ? __eou__

Is there a terminal command to write a ISO image to a USB drive ? __eou__ </d> DD __eou__ *dd* __eou__ are you dual booting or multi-HDD or something __eou__ windows host ? __eou__ windows host , ubuntu guest for virtualbox ? __eou__ </d> Nope , Ubuntu host . Ubuntu guest __eou__ </d> shouldn't effect your booting in __eou__ suggest you reinstall grub . assuming no other changes , your root system and data should be present and safe . perhaps the bootloader scrambled somehow ? __eou__ </d> The computer seems fine up until the login screen . I can even get into the account , but it locks completely up as soon as the desktop loads- so I think the problem is with Ubuntu rather than the bootloader . Does that make sense ? __eou__ </d> you explained it quite well , and you're right . forget my suggestion , it 's not the bootloader . __eou__ hey do you have an admin user account for managing your system and a normal user account for everyday use ? __eou__ </d> No . My everyday account is an admin . __eou__ It 's the default setting and I never changed it __eou__ </d> oh . ok . *ahem* __eou__ any other users touch your system ? __eou__ </d> Yeah ... that 's what I was worried about . No one else touched it . __eou__ </d> ok , I don't know what 's going on there , but you should at least be able to boot to the command line ... __eou__ </d> I tried sudo dd . This is what I got- " unable to change to sudoers gid : Operation not permitted sudo : <unk> () [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] -> [ 116 , -1 , <unk> : Operation not permitted " __eou__

can you be more specific __eou__ </d> when the installer gets to the part where it installs GRUB and bootloader , it asks if I want to install to the bootsector . I select no and specify the partition I want it on , at which point it fails . This has happened on two different computers too , I'm certain it 's a problem in the installer itself __eou__ </d> do you have another bootloader installed on the MBR ? __eou__ </d> yes , one for Truecrypt for an encrypted install of Windows . I don't know how to configure chainloading so I'd prefer to keep it in-place __eou__ normally I'd just install the GRUB loader on the partition , so I could escape out of the Truecrypt one and boot Linux __eou__ </d> have you tried doing it manually ? __eou__

Ubuntu seems interested in adopting wayland . However , where does that place xorg given that it has massive harware support which will be virtually impossible to build for wayland given that how new it is ? __eou__ </d> http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/551 __eou__ Also , the Ubuntu status https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wayland __eou__ </d> Thanks ... __eou__ However , I dont understand this : The major advantage of wayland lies in integrated compositor Weston working at Wayland level . Now in ubuntu 's vision , compiz still exists and sits on top of wayland . So then how does this improve anything from X11 , whose major flaw was a redundancy in compositor ? __eou__ </d> Westion is the reference implementation of a compositor , but Wayland is a protocol for *any* compositor __eou__

Is it possible to use libseccomp as a total sandboxing solution so that I can use to test untrusted codes . __eou__ </d> if you are executing untrusted codes you should use SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER , which is really simple and highly portable __eou__ i.e. works on old linux and all arches , unlike the filter mode **SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT __eou__ </d> Thanks for the given <unk> . I will first read more on seccomp to develop a solution for the execution of untrusted code . Thanks again and appreciate your support . __eou__

Any ideas on how to install Ubuntu on a VPS that currently has Debian and only SSH access to it ? __eou__ </d> Usually I believe , if the versions aren't too far apart , you can change the <unk> . list and do a dist-upgrade ... but there *are* differences , so do research on that suggestion of try it out locally in a VM before doing it on the production VPS __eou__ </d> are there any other safer ways to ? __eou__ </d> That 's the safest I think ; it 's not something to do lightly though ... better to backup the configuration and start afresh for a production server .

hello , I'm trying to mount remote dir via SSHFS with a BASH script . How should I write my password into it ? I want the script to mount the dir automatically , so that I don't have to type in the password . __eou__ </d> You should use " ssh-copy-id " to copy your digital key to the remote server , after that , the key will be used to authenticate rather than asking for a password __eou__ Are you relying on autofs on the server to unlock and mount the encrypted file-system when the ssh connection occurs ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__
aloha ! i want to change the behavior of a function key : i want it to just toggle bluetooth and not wifi . i have the same problem this guy has : https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=131973 what am i missing ? __eou__ not even related __eou__ it is all about acpi __eou__ </d> tried keytouch package ? __eou__ </d> keytouch is about X keyboard shortcuts , right ? if so then it does nto help __eou__ when i boot wiht acpi =o ff the toggle stops working as expected , so i can narrwo it down to acpi and exclude a hardware switch . __eou__ another proof that acpi is involved in some way ist that if i disable the toggleAllWiereless function in acpi-support the behavior changes -> oly wireless is toggled , which i do not understand __eou__ </d> sure you but need to tell XOrg to interpret the input differently , acpi just makes the button work , not define its function __eou__ </d> acpid does __eou__ </d> the input is interpretted by th X server , so you can use an app to change what that signal generated by the button does __eou__ </d> and i am runnign xfce and xbindkeys to define keyboard shortcuts . but i do not need to define functions on a per-user basis . i need to invoke rfkill which requires root privilidges . that is why acpid should handle it __eou__ but ok . i will try touchkey now __eou__ keytouch is not helping . it can only add additional functionality , but not alter the functionality __eou__ </d> bah __eou__

Did you break them ? __eou__ </d> Well , Firefox for some reason decides I don't have a valid SSL certificate on my homepage . __eou__ It works in Firefox on Windows , and it works in Chrome on Ubuntu . But not the default Firefox on Ubuntu . __eou__ And Firefox on Ubuntu lists the certificate authority in its list of valid authorities , it just refuses to use this information to validate my certificate . __eou__ </d> That will likely be because the Ubuntu Firefox installation has revoked one of the CA certificates or doesn't have an intermediate cert __eou__ If you can let me know the URL I'l test it here __eou__ </d> https://berle.cc/ __eou__

Hello , since one week my ubuntu is quite slow to serve website , and find ssh/ftp servers too , its like there is a delay to fetch dns or something like that , I tried to to set dns on google ones but didn " t help . For example I hit : somewebpage.com and its loading for 8sec before getting the site responding . Anyone know what to setup to fix that ? __eou__ </d> use the dig command to test your dns servers __eou__ </d> thanks but how can I check if its correct in the results ? __eou__
my dns is working good , I also cleared them . Delays still present __eou__ </d> did you try disabling ipv6 with the boot option : ipv6 . <unk> __eou__ </d> trying , can we make the disable function working without restarting ? __eou__ </d> may be able to use sysctl but not sure __eou__
Its comming from my computer __eou__ 15 people using same router and they have no issues , also it happened recently , before it was ok __eou__ </d> yes but your router may have optional settings for dns which if not set to the same dns will override your network interface ... it 's an option to consider __eou__ </d> My config is already set to the Router DNS in an automatic way . __eou__

Hi all ! A while ago I stumbled across a network diagnostic tool that was kind of like traceroute , but it had better capabilities . I forget what it was now . Does anyone know what it might be ? __eou__ </d> nmap ( or Zenmap for GUI ) __eou__ </d> nmap is nice , but it wasn't what I was looking for . I finally found it again : mtr ( my traceroute ) is what I was looking for . I'll be keeping nmap handy though . __eou__
To un-mute in alsa hit the m key __eou__ Right or left arrows to move from channel to channel , the m key to toggle <unk> , Up and Down arrows to raise or lower volume . __eou__ </d> I'm aware . However , the option is not even present , nor does the m key toggle anything . This is my usual approach for muting issues , but for whatever reason in openbox the option is not there __eou__ hence my appeals to amixer __eou__ </d> alsamixer __eou__ Open a terminal , issue command alsamixer __eou__ Right or left arrows to move from channel to channel , the m key to toggle <unk> , Up and Down arrows to raise or lower volume . __eou__ </d> Yes , alsamixer . I've used it . Doesn't work , that is what my previous comment reference . I'm fully and completely familiar with alsamixer __eou__ I'm asking about the program " amixer " __eou__ they are different programs __eou__ </d> Use alsamixer , ( I just told you how to use it) . __eou__ </d> the mute option is not available in alsamixer for whatever reason under OpenBox __eou__ hence hte reason I want to give amixer a try __eou__ I've used alsamixer for 7 years now , fully familiar with its capabilities . But amixer is a new beast to me __eou__ </d> If alsamixer doesn't work neither will amixer . Open alsamixer and see if your sound card is properly identified in the upper left corner . __eou__ </d> identified __eou__ </d> ( If alsamixer does not work , your problem is more systemic than just changing volume ... ) __eou__ </d> why would things be fine and dandy in Gnome , but die in OpenBox ? __eou__ </d> I don't know . But does alsamixer identify your sound card correctly ? ( In other words , it says the same as what is in the output of /sbin/lspci |grep udio ) . __eou__

btw wilee-nilee whoever supplied the infobot the that nick completion factoid should change the the spelling to nick , not nic __eou__ </d> that to confusing for you . ;) __eou__ we are lucky it kis not in leet __eou__ </d> not for me but it might be for some , wilee-nilee , afterall spelling is important to those whose english not as good as it could be . __eou__ </d> http://pastebin.com/Cgv1igHc here you go bro __eou__ That 's his fdisk it is a gpt __eou__ You would have to chroot into the install to install there __eou__ </d> are you sure , /dev/sda4 is his ubuntu install , why bothger with chrooting ? __eou__ he 's using the live cd with the terminal __eou__ </d> From a live cd you would have to chroot . As it is he can boot to Ubuntu I believe you can you purge and install all from there . __eou__ It is a GPT it is not msdos partitioning set up , Personally I think a person who know GPT booting wu=ith grub will know what to do . __eou__ </d> I never do chroots to install grub to a different partition __eou__ </d> Cool but I doubt that will fix it but one never knows . I never of had to reload a grub this way . __eou__ I believe GPT can work with grub fine it just needs someone who knows this stuff . __eou__ </d> I wonder if this would have worked for Arcanewater , http://www.wensley.org.uk/gpt __eou__ </d> Not sure to be honest there are official ubuntu wiki 's on this stuff . I spent a long time on the UF helping with grub issues and dualbooting stuff , there were a couple of helpers there who knew this part of it and were on daily , so I let them mess with the unusual partitioning stuff , lol . __eou__ here is one of the best helpers there . http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11509699&postcount=2 __eou__ </d> it looks like grub devs better get a handle this if we're going to see more and more pcs with GPT tables __eou__
I've been having trouble with a new 3TB harddrive and a fresh Ubuntu install . I install ( as GPT ) and the install looks ok . But then get GRUB " error : out of disk " after reboot . I have an October 2011 PC with updated BIOS and I _do_ see the 3TB . __eou__ google searches haven't been to helpful so far . __eou__ has anyone seen GRUB trouble when installing on 3TB harddrives ? __eou__ </d> have you tried installing grub again and updating it ? sudo grub-install ; sudo update-grub ? __eou__ </d> I guess I could try that . So I would have to install GRUB from an older Ubuntu install ? __eou__ </d> I assumed that it dropped you to grub rescue prompt __eou__
You may see the full 3 TiB within linux , but your BIOS doesn't. __eou__ And your BIOS may be up to date , but it 's still buggy :) __eou__ </d> hmm , my BIOS is 2012 . And I did see someone else talk about using a 3TB harddrive . But it 's best to not make any assumptions . __eou__ </d> You can work around this by making a separate /boot partition near the beginning of the <unk> ( note that this is *not* the same as the BIOS Boot Partition) . __eou__
what is the difference between " daily " and " daily-live "? __eou__ http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/precise/daily-live/current __eou__ http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/precise/daily/current __eou__ </d> daily is the text mode installer , daily-live is the live cd __eou__ </d> are there " non-live " ISOs ? is that something to only install Ubuntu but you can't use it as a " Live " CD ? __eou__ </d> yes the daily are not live cds __eou__
Anyone have any ideas ? Logging into gnome from lightdm/gdm just hangs . Logging into awesome is nearly instant . This started today after doing apt-get upgrade to update system .

I assume desktop if he was partitioning and it doesn't sound like he was using a CLI one . __eou__ Of course , I haven't used the Ubuntu alt disc , so I could be wrong . I assume it 's like Arch 's partitioning . __eou__ </d> Oh , no , it 's more like Debian 's than ArchLinux's. __eou__ </d> Ah .. That makes sense . I've used Debian 's too . The alt disc must be really similar to Ubuntu Server then . __eou__ Based on his " brb ", he left to find it . __eou__ </d> Sorry , my English is bad . __eou__ </d> No problem . I'm just informing you . :) I appreciate you helping him with me . __eou__ </d> It seems that he persist on getting one called " LiveCD ". __eou__ persist in* __eou__ I guess phonebook_ created too much primary partitions so that he cann't create one more . __eou__ too many* __eou__ aha , you can . __eou__ </d> You should be able to have as much free space as you want though since it 's not a partition , per se . __eou__ </d> just wget it . __eou__ and use a tool , say fbv , to show . __eou__ </d> I don't have a GUI period . Are you saying there 's a way to view images without one ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__ fbv __eou__ </d> Oooh . I'll look into this . Thanks . __eou__ </d> If you have framebuffer . __eou__ It 's also okay to browse the Internet in virtual console , say tty1 , but it seems ugly . __eou__ zack68491 said that the cursor occurred . __eou__ </d> From what I can tell , the computer doesn't know what to boot . __eou__ That 's just my guess though . __eou__ </d> Oh , I know nothing about UEFI . __eou__ </d> Neither do I . I've only used BIOS . :P __eou__ It 's slang sort of . __eou__ It 's not officially correct , but it 's correct to our eyes . If that made sense . __eou__ </d> But it 's really hard to non-native speakers . __eou__ </d> Yeah I know . Nothing I can do about it though . I don't use it . I'm weird and like being grammatically correct . __eou__
I have a pc w/ no operating system . It just has the BIOS . How can I tell if it is 32 or 64 bit , so I know which Ubuntu iso to install ? __eou__ </d> How much RAM too ? __eou__ How much RAM do you have ? __eou__ How much RAM ? If it 's less than 4GB , then you might as well use 32bit instead of guessing that it 's 64bit . __eou__ </d> It has 2 GB Ram , so I guess 32 is going to be the way I will go __eou__
I installed Ubuntu using Wubi . If I want a dual-boot , I have no choice but to re-install Ubuntu right ? __eou__ </d> you can transfer that wubi to a partition hold on . __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MigrateWubi Make sure you are aware of the amount of partitions on a single hard drive and what type . __eou__ amount of partitions meaning the limitations __eou__ </d> I have 2 hard drives on my computer , so my ( perhaps naive ) assumption is that makes it simpler to have 2 operating systems __eou__ </d> I would agree that a actual dual boot os beter then a wubi install . __eou__ </d> I would not have used wubi if I had known it was any different from partitioning things out normally . __eou__ </d> no biggie it can be migrated to a partition with just running code , I would back up any thing important there first though . __eou__ </d> nothing important :) __eou__ </d> cool then follow the wiki , put it on the second HD if you like , just be aware of the limit to the amount of primary partitions , ubuntu can be in a extened as a logical partition so that you have a swap a s well if you have 3 primaries on a single disc already . __eou__ </d> sorry , I don't think I understand . why do I need to watch the limit of the number of partitions ? __eou__ </d> there is a rule that if you have more then 4 primary partitions in hd that is a standard msdos setup it will make the disc go dynamic , you don't want that . __eou__ I have to assume you have a msdos regular common setup when I warn you of this . __eou__ </d> the D drive does not have any operating system installed on it , the windows OS is on C drive . would msdos still be installed on the second disc ? __eou__ </d> probably , you could boot a live ubuntu cd and look at it with gparted or use the windows partitioner to identify it . __eou__ are you sure that D is a second HD , not just a partition ? __eou__
Nah . __eou__ Just means a process didn't die when it should have . __eou__ When you get to CMOS , tell me what CPU you have . __eou__ </d> It has an AMD dual core __eou__ let me go look .

Thanks to both . Cheers ! __eou__ </d> If this is your first time using Linux , I can walk you through your first configuration . __eou__ </d> Thanks for the offer .

i need a little help expanding the partition that ubuntu is on __eou__ ive got stupid gparted installed __eou__ but when i try to resize the stupid partition gparted just explains implicitly that it is uselss __eou__ </d> gparted is OK . __eou__ How many partition do you have ? __eou__ Now there're four primary partitions . __eou__ Therefore you cannot create one more . __eou__ It seems that sda1 , sda2 , sda3 , sda5 , sda6 , sda7 are mounted . __eou__ Try to resize sda4 __eou__ to fulfill the free space on the fourth row . __eou__ Are you using a CD ? __eou__ Oh , you cannot resize it immediately __eou__ Too many partitions are mounted , therefore they are locked . __eou__ You cannot operate on them . __eou__ In order to enlarge sda4 , the logical partitions , say sda5 , sda6 , sda7 , should be unmounted . __eou__ </d> it doesnt give me the option __eou__ </d> They are locked , therefore the options are GREY . __eou__ </d> wait yes it does , hold on .. __eou__
I recommend using an Ubuntu CD since the Windows partitioner is pretty bad . __eou__ </d> you don't watch youtube ? __eou__ </d> Not really . __eou__

you could use something like " expect " or generate the password hash from script and update the users /etc/shadow entry __eou__ </d> i believe what i'm trying to do is simpler : i.e. when i type $ adduser me it goes on to prompt me for a password . i just want to put my password as a command line arg instead of being prompted for it __eou__ so i want something like : " adduser $LINUXUSER -p <unk> ", only i don't think that -p is correct . but you get what i'm trying to do __eou__ well adduser is the high level version of useradd . useradd is linux , adduser is ubuntu 's " helper " __eou__ </d> oh you can also use usermod to set password __eou__
Hi everyone , I have got a dedicated server , I want to setup ubuntu 12 on it . I don't know much about security , are there any automated ways of hardening a ubuntu box ? __eou__ Is this the right thing to do ? http://www.thefanclub.co.za/node/52 __eou__ </d> i would also pentest your own server services too __eou__ you have to go beyond and think like an attacker __eou__ after setting up the server nmap your server ip __eou__ </d> can I pvt msg you ? __eou__
would the ubuntu file systems be corrupted on mulitple direct power offs(without shutting down ) due to power cuts ? if so anyway to identify and correct the errors ? __eou__ </d> That applies for any file system on any system . __eou__ Use the fsck and badblocks commands . __eou__ </d> well i am not well versed with the syntaxes of those commands . how to use them ? __eou__ also no apparent problems coming up , so is it necessary to use those commands ? __eou__ </d> While it might sound harsh : read the man page . __eou__ </d> k __eou__

i want to check ntfs file systems __eou__ is fsck ok with ntfs __eou__ </d> no , you'd need to use chkdsk from windows __eou__ </d> i dont have windows installed __eou__
the right thing to do would be understanding what happens there and doing it manually , fitted to your servers purpose __eou__ in my opinion it is vital to understand security basics when operating a server , not using automated tools or scripts . __eou__ </d> I agree but I am very new to linux and I can't find someone who could secure the box properly for me __eou__ </d> and you need that server that urgent so you don't have the time to read about the things it does ? I really recommend you do . __eou__

if i have enough ram , is it possible to request that ubuntu load all system components into it at boot time and then work fast as heck afterwards ? __eou__ </d> theoretically yes , but that means a boatload of ram __eou__ </d> i have 16GB , but don't really need more than 8 for myself . i can't imagine ubuntu uses more than 8 on its own ? __eou__ </d> no , but consider what happens when you start using it , for instance , playing a video . Certainly worth trying though . I'd be interested to hear how it goes . __eou__ clean install . don't be lazy . __eou__
how can I command the syslog to log timestamps in ISO 8601 format ? ie .

I want to change just because Im setting up my own parser , and it is ridiculous to not use a machine friendly format for a log file , and especially not to log the year ; problems around new year .. __eou__ </d> No . __eou__

I have Linux MInt with some partitions (/usr/local /home ... ) . I want to install Ubuntu but I dont want to remake the partitions . Can Ubuntu recognize and use that partitions ? __eou__ </d> you want to install ubuntu into the mint partitions(and know , that mint will get deletet ) __eou__ </d> no problem , I dont like Mint . But will Ubuntu recognize /home or it will be like a mounted volume ? __eou__ </d> you can choose the partitions manually during the installation process __eou__ </d> sould I just change the Mint / to the Ubuntu / ? __eou__ </d> so instead of creating new ones you can use the existing ones and format it __eou__ </d> if I format them I will lost my data , I dont want that . __eou__
HOW CAN IT look like normal computer ? __eou__ heres screenshot : http://wereproxy.com/ __eou__ i think no , but that dosent help with gui __eou__ look at the screenshot __eou__ the icons are half size , everything is blurry , text is 3 times what i have in windows __eou__ i want normal gui like in old linuxes or windows __eou__ it is __eou__ How am i supposed to work on something like that ? __eou__ the distortion is that text and button are blurry and are size of elephant __eou__ yes , but can i install other gui into that virtual machine ? i dont want to reinstall entire os __eou__ </d> That is NOT a screenshot , it is a website . __eou__ your issue is unsupported . There is no way to know what the deal is with some random VM . Download an actual install cd , mount the iso in the VM and install it . __eou__ your issue is unsupported . The end . __eou__ </d> text blur is unsupported ? __eou__ im not spamming nothing , i just wanted to ask why eveything looks like for 3year kid in ubuntu 11.10 __eou__ </d> you most certainly ARE spamming a website . You have given it 3 times insisting it is a screenshot . __eou__ open a terminal in your vm and give me the output of lsb_release -sc __eou__ </d> wait a second , system is booting __eou__ oneiric __eou__ </d> uname -r __eou__ again ... at the end of the day ... you need to just download an actual official ubuntu install cd , and boot to that , and do an official install . This will probably fix any issues you are having . __eou__ </d> but you dont understand .. it will be same __eou__ the screenshot from ubuntu are same __eou__ </d> You say that this is the case ... but you have not done it . If it is the case , then the problem is with your windows VM __eou__

There is a router between the webserver and the internet , right ? __eou__ </d> We dont know . __eou__ </d> Sorry , wrong nic __eou__ </d> The subnet mask /24 or <unk> . <unk> tells you that your network range is from <unk> . 1.0 to . 255 whereas . 0 is the network address and . 255 is the broadcast address . __eou__ Thats a static lease , but not a static IP . __eou__ </d> Yea , well , same difference . __eou__ Ok , yes you are correct . But , essentially the PC gets a static IP ( either way) . __eou__ It 's just a matter of terms . __eou__ </d> No . Using a static lease , the PC gets a DHCP IP which is always the same ;) __eou__ </d> If it is always the same it is " static " ( as opposed to " dynamic " ) . __eou__ </d> As long as it is served by the _D_HCP server , it isnt a static IP . __eou__ </d> Anyway , it doesnt matter , but you are correct , it is refered to ( in router configs ) as " static lease ". __eou__ </d> A DHCP cant assign static IPs , but only static leases . __eou__ </d> Ok , I get your point , ( but the fact remains that if the IP address does not change , it is " static ", ( by definition of the word " static " ) . __eou__ </d> static refers to the lease , not to the IP . __eou__ </d> I told you once already , " You are correct , it is refered to as a " static lease ". __eou__ You are more than likely correct . But it is also quite possbile that this router also starts at the bottom of the list when assigning IPs i.e. 192.168 . 1.2 , 192.168 . 1.3 etc . etc . __eou__ </d> Thats the RFC compliant behaviour of a DHCP server :) __eou__ </d> Thanks for your constructive criticism :) ( but it was not <unk> ) __eou__ </d> Your comment wasnt helpful , too . __eou__ </d> Ok , if you think I am giving false information ; SAY SO ! __eou__ </d> No one accused you of giving false information . There is a big difference between false and useless information , you know ? __eou__

Hello . I used Ubuntu for a few years up until a couple of years ago when my school required that I buy a Mac . I'm not considering using Ubuntu again but I'm not sure . I'm a themer , and I see that GTK2 is now replaced in part by <unk> . is there any GTK3 pixmap engine , or anything like it ? __eou__ </d> we use unico by default , and there is adwaita too included with gtk3 __eou__ </d> yes , but do ALL elements have to be coded via CSS , or can you tell it " draw the button using this image in this location ?" for whatever you'd like ? __eou__ </d> oh , I imagine you can still use images , look at the Ambiance theme , there are a bunch of images in the gtk- 3.0 <unk> folder __eou__ you'd need to use css still though , you can just use the <unk> ) property __eou__
how do I setup a basic mailserver on Ubuntu ? I need SMTP __eou__ sudo apt-get install smtp !? __eou__ </d> " sudo apt-get install postfix " __eou__ Where 's it being hosted ? I saw the emails recently but didn't look closely __eou__ thanks __eou__ That 's BSD syntax , but yes , it should . Unix/Linux syntax would be " -efly " __eou__ </d> oh ?! ... so ps -efly | grep NAME __eou__ </d> BSD doesn't precede options with the " - " __eou__ No , the " ps " command is available on multiple operating systems and on , say , BSD , it expects different options . The program is built to accept three options forms : BSD , Unix , and GNU __eou__

hi guys , is this the correct place for technical questions ? __eou__ thanks :) __eou__ how does Ubuntu read the name of the device when something is connected via USB ? __eou__ nope , my final target is to change the name of the device I'm connecting to USB , that 's why I'd like to know what ubuntu reads , so I can change it on the device :) __eou__ I guess the device sends its " device name " somehow __eou__ </d> udev is the device manager for the Linux kernel __eou__ What you probably want to do is to create a fstab entry for the device . THat way you can assign a persistant mount point __eou__ </d> it 's not about ubuntu configurations __eou__
hey guys , should i look fro drivers from my manuacturer or use a built in driver thing ? __eou__ *for __eou__ *manufacturer __eou__ </d> drivers built-in to the Linux kernel are absolutely the best option , if they work for you . __eou__ do you need 3D acceleration in Linux ? __eou__ " prefer " is not " need ." i have an AMD APU . i'd prefer 3D . but it 's not worth the hassle of fglrx over the kernel 's " radeon " driver . for me . __eou__ it 's not a subject lending itself to quick discussion on IRC . - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit __eou__ stop installing that ATI driver you just downloaded . __eou__ you are making a bad decision . __eou__ </d> DON'T install it ? o_0 __eou__ </d> yes . do NOT install that . __eou__ it is not in any way tied to the Ubuntu package system . it is installed by you alone . you alone will need to maintain it . if you ever get a kernel upgrade , you will boot into the terminal , reconfigure the latest driver to match the latest kernel , enable the module , reboot , and check X configuration . you know how to do all that , right ? __eou__ then as i said , you do not NEED 3D acceleration . __eou__ can you see a GUI ? __eou__ then *what do you need another driver for* ? __eou__ http://linux.die.net/man/4/radeon __eou__
hey guys , should i look fro drivers from my manuacturer or use a built in driver thing ? __eou__ *for __eou__ *manufacturer __eou__ </d> Depends on the hardware you want to use . __eou__ Which error ...? __eou__ The message is pretty clear - you are arranging your displays in a ways that you break a limit . __eou__ </d> how would i change said limit __eou__ </d> You cant . Arrange your displays so they dont break that limit . __eou__ And together , they are bigger than your virtual desktop size . __eou__ Because windows uses another driver . __eou__

hi guys , is this the correct place for technical questions ? __eou__ thanks :) __eou__ how does Ubuntu read the name of the device when something is connected via USB ? __eou__ nope , my final target is to change the name of the device I'm connecting to USB , that 's why I'd like to know what ubuntu reads , so I can change it on the device :) __eou__ I guess the device sends its " device name " somehow __eou__ I think I should change the question ... how can I change the name a linux device sends when it is connected ? __eou__ :) __eou__ </d> The name you see is the " label " you give to the file-system __eou__ if you haven't given the file-system a label you'll see the UUID - a weird-looking mix of alpha-numerics __eou__ </d> like I connect a phone via USB __eou__ </d> You can use , from the terminal , the command " sudo dosfslabel /dev/SOMEDEVICE new-label " for a FAT32 DOS file-system that is typically used in mobile phones __eou__ </d> problem is that 's not a fix , that just makes Ubuntu see it as a different name __eou__ I will still see the wrong name if I connect it to another machine __eou__ </d> no you won't. That command will change the label on the file-system __eou__ </d> but still , I'd like to be able to change the config on the device , not force it to show another thing :) __eou__ </d> As we've already said ... that name comes from the file-system 's label . change the label , that 's it . __eou__ </d> and which files do I have to change on the device ? not from ubuntu :) __eou__ </d> You don't. It 's the file-system label . Once it is changed all devices will see the new label __eou__ </d> so they issue a terminal command on all phones before sending them to stores ? :D __eou__ </d> I give up . You obviously know more than me on this . __eou__ </d> is that ironic ? I'm really trying to understand :) but I think you're not getting my point :) __eou__ </d> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive __eou__ </d> maybe this is a better question then , how do I change the label if you have the image of that filesystem ? :) __eou__ </d> You'd loop-mount the image so it appears as a device <unk> ) and then address it the same way as any other device __eou__ </d> that requires changing the name from my ubuntu machine ... while I want to change the name from the device itself , is that doable ? __eou__ </d> That would depend on the device itself , and the OS and tools on it . __eou__
how do I change my icons in newest ubuntu ? I installed an icon pack to /usr/share/icons and relogged , but I guess there 's an additional step ? __eou__ </d> use gnome-tweak-tool or myunity __eou__ </d> which one do you recommend most ? __eou__

I ran " lsusb -v " but couldn't find any bluetooth adapters . I know this laptop has one though , so that 's not the problem . __eou__ </d> Maybe the rfkill is on ? or it might be a PCI device ? __eou__ </d> The what ? I should've said that I have second to no experience with Linux . :p __eou__ </d> Many laptops have a hardware switch to control power to the bluetooth and/or wifi radios . They can sometimes prevent the bluetooth adapter even being recognised __eou__ </d> And I believe that the Bluetooth radio is shared with the WiFi adapter . I mean , if I disable the WiFi with the switch on the side , the bluetooth is gone as well . __eou__ lol . Yeah , that 's turned on . I'm on WiFi right now . __eou__ </d> That sounds about right , so it isn't that then . I've Googled and can't see anyone else reporting any bluetooth problem so I'm guessing this could be unique to you __eou__ </d> Yeah , ofcourse I've googled this situation but couldn't find anything . __eou__ </d> Do you know for sure if it is connected via USB ? Could it be via the PCI bus ( " lspci -nn " ) __eou__ </d> could be . I'm going to check that out right now . __eou__ If I execute that command I get flooded with information . I grep'd that with " Ath " and got 2 hits , the WiFi adapter and the Ethernet adapter .

If you create two swap partitions for each instance of Ubuntu you want to install on a single drive , will each instance use their own swap partition you specify ?

While installing Ubuntu a few months back , I was inexperienced . I have learned later that I made a big mistake - I did not assign any swap space .

But if you have not created a swap partition , that will need to be done first . __eou__ </d> How would I do so ? __eou__ </d> You will need to use something like gparted . You could resize the MS Windows partition to a smaller size and allow about 4Gig or so for a small swap partition . __eou__ and create the 4Gig swap partition and designate it as swap in the /etc/fstab file . __eou__ </d> I do not have Windows , only Ubuntu . __eou__ </d> You use the startup CD which has gparted on it . __eou__ </d> In other words , I will lose files ? __eou__ </d> Or you can download a gparted liveCD __eou__ Or you can download a gparted liveCD from http://gparted.sourceforge.net/download.php __eou__ </d> I should have backups of my more important files .

If you create two swap partitions for each instance of Ubuntu you want to install on a single drive , will each instance use their own swap partition you specify ?

Hi . I've been looking into drivers for laptops and it looks like hybrid graphics can get problematic on Linux .

Hi . I've been looking into drivers for laptops and it looks like hybrid graphics can get problematic on Linux . Does anyone know if amd or nvidia cards are better supported in this way , with current drivers ? ( free or proprietary ) __eou__ </d> hybrid setups are a clusterf*ck __eou__ gaming on a laptop is almost always a disappointment anyway . If you use linux exclusively you may as well just use a slightly cheaper laptop and then pour cash into a gaming desktop __eou__ </d> that 's a great idea ! It literally never occurred to me __eou__ </d> well , good luck with that :) I've never really been satisfied with the everything-in-one laptop . Typically they don't perform well enough or they are noisy , hot and plastic'y __eou__ well , never buy a pc before you're set up somewhere ;) __eou__
Nvidia works great for me . Always has __eou__ amd is ok ... but needs work . __eou__ </d> do you have a laptop ? __eou__ </d> Go with Nvidia , even on a laptop it rocks . Nvidia means dedicated graphics . __eou__ then you have your answer . You might prefer to sacrifice graphics quality for power . Do you game much ? __eou__ </d> I think I probably will game quite a bit if I have a dedicated card . That 's why I'm putting so much weight on this decision __eou__
oh thanks __eou__ </d> just sayin ' - installing nvidia.com 's driver is probably a bad idea ... __eou__ </d> cant tell if sarcasm __eou__ Thinkpad W520 __eou__ pretty new and well supported ( or so ive heard ) __eou__ its got the optimus graphics __eou__ between an intel 3000 __eou__

Most use a GUI in settings/user accounts to remove an existing user . __eou__ </d> any suggestions ? __eou__ </d> When you ask how to remove accounts in this channel noone would assume you have issues surrounding dovecot . __eou__ How to you store account information for the users ? __eou__ Sorry to interrupt you . There is good information surrounding the dovecot and tools are available . __eou__ If you create your own scripts to pass the information from your PHP to shell scripts you need to know where you store the information . __eou__ </d> it 's done via useradd __eou__ </d> john515 In that case deluser should be sufficient . You may need to enfoce to remove the maildir or do it by hand . Do you have SQL to store the user info ? __eou__ What I meant was the odd /var/spool/mail and such . __eou__ It you don't use SQL , do you store the user inof in /etc/passwd ? There are other methods as well . Also , see __eou__ If you find them in /var/spool/mail with upper case i would assume their other dirs are the same . __eou__ Not sure if I get this one right . If you have user ' John ' in /etc/passwd but you try to authorize as john it will fail . __eou__ Do you have <unk> ... ? __eou__ </d> also , those two notorious usernames , when freshly register - they are all lowercase , but when my user tries to login with roundcube - mail . log says he tries to log with first letter uppercase __eou__ no such directory __eou__ </d> Does your /etc/passwd contain the login id in lower cae but their home dir in Upper ? __eou__ </d> both lowercase , completelly __eou__ </d> Did you get the info from faillog ? __eou__ </d> any clue where I can locate it ? __eou__
no biggie easy fix to set stock . http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/how-to-reset-unity-launcher-icons-or.html __eou__ set it stock and find one of the hundred blogs on setting up compiz , it is easy you just need to do it right and have a restsrt schema for compiz . __eou__ </d> I have nothing when I am in ubuntu can I do that reset thing while in ubuntu2D ? __eou__ </d> I believe so . __eou__ I assume you did a restart and checked if the 3d desktop was still broken , compiz does not always reneder changes well and needs a restart , I use the compiz fusion icon as a button to do a restart . __eou__ </d> it seems to have worked but it is still doing stuff and I am getting a lot of warnings and errors in the terminal __eou__ think I should just control C it ? __eou__
ok I made some changes to compiz , now ubuntu is crashed but ubuntu 2D works __eou__ anyone want to help me get ubuntu back ? and what is the diff between ubuntu 2D and just ubuntu __eou__ </d> Ubuntu2D doesn't use compiz . __eou__ </d> should I just keep using Ubuntu2D , ? __eou__ how to I get ubuntu back __eou__ </d> There 's nothing wrong with using Unity2D if it works , but how to fix compiz depends on what exactly you did with compiz . __eou__ </d> I set top edge left edge and right edge to 0 in the grid setting __eou__

I have a computer that I was using as a file server running Ubuntu 10.04 . The system crashed today giving me a " Kernal Panic-not syncing : VFS : Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block ( 0 , 0 ) " error message every time at startup . I've removed the drive , and have it in a portable hard drive reader . However , when I open the drive with a windows computer , it shows the disk as being almost full , __eou__ but not showing me any files . Is there a way to read the drive to at least pull some of the files off of it ? __eou__ </d> windows wont read the filesystem , do you have a actual read of it , using a install of a driver to read it ? __eou__ <unk> , yeah , it takes a bit to figure it out . __eou__ </d> I don't have anything other than another windows computer right now . If I re-install it back in the Ubuntu box and run the LiveCD , would that allow me read the existing files ? __eou__ The files I'm looking to get back off of it are windows files that I was using the Ubuntu box to file serve __eou__ </d> <unk> , great thing is there are a ton of links on the web for help . __eou__ Yes , if it is readable that is the best way . __eou__ </d> I'll give that a shot -- downloading the LiveCD now . Thank you for your input , sir ! __eou__
compiz can be tweaked if done with some knowledge of how it works and looking at the info on the web on setting it up custom , you just need a restart buton , and then save the script of the setup when done , for future quick installs of those settings . I have the same script since natty or so . __eou__ </d> " some knowledge " being the important words there . :) __eou__ </d> windows wont read the filesystem , do you have a actual read of it , using a install of a driver to read it ? __eou__ <unk> , yeah , it takes a bit to figure it out . __eou__ </d> And the process will most likely involve wrecking your desktop a few times . __eou__

Can some one explain the logic behind ubuntu trimming old packages from newer versions ?

mount : mount point /mnt/dev is not a directory mount : mount point /mnt/dev/pts is not a directory mount : mount point /mnt/sys is not a directory __eou__ </d> That script is from the grub wiki . __eou__ </d> so I don't need boot-repair for this ? __eou__ </d> my pastebin that is use the wiki you will see the same commands except for the added partition numbers , etc and the purge and reinstall .

Hi everyone . I'm having trouble with the wireless network on a brand new System76 Pangolin laptop . Seems to have started after suspending . I have already enabled/disabled wireless , turned off/on the wireless card and rebooted the machine several times . It happened earlier today when I disabled the card with the keyboard Fn key but it came back eventually when I disabled/enabled using the network icon . __eou__ </d> I don't understand what the problem is ? __eou__ </d> I can't seem to reach hosts . The wireless network detects networks , connects to them , but when I try to navigate using the browser , it says it can't connect to the host . Using IPs doesn't work either . Can't even ping the router __eou__ </d> Do you happen to be using a DD-WRT or Open-WRT router ? __eou__ </d> my router is an SMC __eou__ yes , the wired network is fine . And I can connect my phone wirelessly to it without a problem __eou__ </d> Could I get a copy of your ' lsmod ' output ? And then possibly the output of ' dmesg | grep wlan0 ' __eou__ </d> one second , it might take a bit since I'll have to copy it to a usb or something . Or would it affect the output if I connect the laptop on the wired network ? __eou__ </d> No it shouldn't, just as long as you don't restart the computer __eou__ </d> just paste the output here ? __eou__ </d> On pastebin or a related site , yes __eou__ </d> http://pastebin.com/U8D3ZzWW __eou__ </d> Why are you running virtualbox drivers ? __eou__ </d> I need virtualbox to test IE . Wireless was working earlier today , after I set up Virtualbox __eou__ yes , I used it all day today and it stopped working all of a sudden __eou__ I am not using a virtualbox guest at themoment __eou__ no , whatever is default __eou__ I tried disabling ipv6 to see if that helped __eou__ you're saying I should enable it ? __eou__ so I'm re-enabling ipv6 ( method Automatic ) __eou__ </d> Ok . And if that doesn't work , set it solely to ipv4 . __eou__
Anyone know how to convert flv vids from youtube to something readable in a regular home dvd player ? __eou__ </d> that 's illegal , isnt it ? __eou__ </d> Not if they are home vids __eou__ </d> if they're home vids , then why are you having to rip them off youtube ? __eou__ </d> not really home vids , rather foreign vids that may or may not be home vids . __eou__ </d> so " someone else ' home vids " __eou__ so you're a pedo is what you're saying ? you watch " home videos " but they're not necessarily your own ... __eou__ </d> As a minor and as a female , it 's hard to be considered a pedo . haha __eou__
Hrm , still trying to connect to ipv6 for some reason . This is after dhclient , <unk> ? __eou__ </d> when I checked both require ipv4 AND ipv6 , the connection kept on being dropped and <unk> .

hi anyone has time to help me trouble shoot my wireless adapter ? __eou__ i am running 12.04 __eou__ i am using an Asus wireless pci adpater , chipset is Ralink <unk> , kernel module in use is rt2800pci __eou__ it does not work with kernel 3.2 . 0.29 __eou__ </d> the current kernel is 3.2 . <unk> , anything beyond that is not supported and/or probably unstable __eou__ </d> i installed backport kernel modules , and loaded the rt2800 ko , still can not connect , i can see my access point but it will not establish any connection __eou__ i just got the kernel from ubuntu update , they just pushed it out today , i had same problem on 3.2 . 0.27 as well __eou__ also the wireless card seem to work under kernel 3.4 , but ati fglrx is not working .. so i guess i am trying to get both to work . __eou__ </d> you're right : kernel -29 here too __eou__
So I installed Ubuntu , and as it boots up it gives me an out of range monitor error , which was slightly inconvenient but not too much of an issue because once it gets to LightDM it works fine . __eou__ However now I'm trying to install NVidia drivers , which forces me to log out and boot into a terminal session . __eou__ Which is out of range . __eou__ I've tried all sorts of things , and I'm frustrated at this point . __eou__ I even tried plugging it into another monitor __eou__ </d> Are you familiar with getting to the GRUB boot menu , and altering the Linux kernel 's command line ? __eou__ When the PC starts , immediately after the BIOS display , the GRUB bootloader menu can be accessed by holding down the shift key . Once you have that menu , you can edit one of the entries to change the kernel command line to avoid the " out of range " issue . __eou__ You can install the Nvidia drivers from the GUI once you're logged in __eou__ No , from the GUI you can install them ... top-right corner , press the gear icon , then choose " System Settings ..." > Harware > Additional Drivers __eou__ </d> I have another issue in that there 's a bug with the drivers that menu provides . __eou__ </d> what 's the bug ? __eou__ Is the graphics in your PC very recent ? __eou__
<unk> : That PC must have a rather ancient CPU ? __eou__ <unk> : The kernel builds for i386 based CPUs were changed to by default support Processor Address Extensions ( PAE) .

See my previous comment . Look right to you ( reguarding andrewh192s issue) ? __eou__ </d> Yes , I had read those , but I'm looking at the official builds to be sure . I believe the mini . iso is non PAE but its a bit of pain having to install from that first __eou__ </d> Ah , I see . May be a little more complex than usual . Good point __eou__ </d> Last thing we want is to download that image and then find out its the same PAE kernel ! __eou__ </d> Hahaha . Yeah guess that would be a drag . Is pae a built in or can it be turned on and off ? __eou__ </d> It 's built-in ... its core to how the CPU addresses memory . With PAE a 32-bit CPU can address more than 4GB of RAM __eou__ </d> Ah gotcha . Thought their might be a kernel option to enable / disable it on the fly . Guess that wouldn't make sense though since it probably needs to be compiled a certain way . __eou__ Think andrewh192 took off already __eou__ </d> looking at the archives , there 's -generic and -generic-pae linux-image for 3.2 so that would imply the generic is non-PAE but not sure which ISOs they would be in . Yes saw andrew192 go ... lets hope he is successful __eou__ </d> I'm sure he'll be fine . Or we'll see him again haha __eou__ </d> The support hardware page for the release installation instructions is a bit disingenuous on this : " Nearly all x86-based ( IA-32 ) processors still in use in personal computers are supported , including all varieties of Intel 's " Pentium " series . This also includes 32-bit AMD and VIA ( former Cyrix ) processors , and processors like the Athlon XP and Intel P4 Xeon . " __eou__ </d> Yeah , I have no clue . Never used a pae kernel before . __eou__ </d> it was standard in the server variants for many years __eou__ </d> I heard about it a long time ago but never needed to use it personally . __eou__ Yeah . There 's all kinds of interesting things you can do in GNU __eou__ </d> That shouldn't take down the entire router though __eou__ At most , the single PC would get confused __eou__ </d> For some reason some devices cannot connect back . Sounds crazy but true I assure you __eou__

Compile time hahahaha __eou__ Oh that 's right . Closed source . __eou__ Well , probably still have to build a module __eou__ Partition issues ? __eou__ Do you still have the source code if the original install ? The bad one ? __eou__

let me just say ubuntu team not updating repos for older versions is lame __eou__ very very very lame __eou__ </d> did you have a support question ? __eou__ when releases are ! EOL , their repos are no longer updated , that is correct __eou__ </d> just saying you guys want ubuntu to be taken serious yet you don't even update repos , you essentially abandon majority of your users and force them to get latest ubunut __eou__ that 's not reliable and causes many issues being new __eou__ that 's not the way imho __eou__ last few version of ubunut at the very least should have full access to latest repo __eou__ windows xp doesn't have this problem , they release service packs __eou__ yes they do __eou__ </d> no rants here , please __eou__ </d> in fact they released 3 . __eou__ xp is heavily used thats why microsoft extended support till 2014 __eou__ I think it 's 2014 __eou__ anyway my point is this , ubuntu doesn't change that much that past distros shouldn't have access to latest repo , but i'll look into rolling release , thanks __eou__ and I appreciate your guys hard work __eou__
Ubuntu messes up my wifi after downloading something thru firefox __eou__ yes __eou__ Noone can use wifi till i restart router again __eou__ It connects just doesn't work __eou__ How can that be ? __eou__ Only happens on ubuntu __eou__ :/ __eou__ If it 's not hot to touch it 's ok ? __eou__ Maybe it is a BIT warm __eou__ But ... __eou__ </d> I have had similar issues before . Totally get it . I usually just unplug and plug the router __eou__ Here is one thing that can mess you up : If you have android devices connected to yoru router then make sure the router is not assigning multiple ip addresses to the same device __eou__ If you do run into that issue then try assigning a static ip address to the device . __eou__ </d> That isn't the case , unfortunately __eou__ </d> Try assigning static ip addresses to the devices in question and rebooting the router . That might work . __eou__ </d> I'll try , but i'm not sure how to do that on android or ubuntu __eou__
Why is typing a ' R ' in xterm a dead key ? I'm wondering about this for years and it 's impossible to search with google for it . __eou__ </d> Sounds like you might have a readline binding for R __eou__ bind -p | grep R __eou__ </d> indeed - " R ": self-insert __eou__ bash , that is . __eou__ /me will read about that . Thanks __eou__ </d> self-insert means R should just produce itself ( an R) , so that 's not where your problem lies __eou__ </d> well , " R " is the only letter there __eou__ wrong __eou__ you're right __eou__

Guess I need winrar too though __eou__ Need to install this thing or what ? __eou__ </d> can you just db click , i am hoping its a self extracting archive __eou__ </d> It 's not . But , TJ- Has the exe oped up already . Tell TJ- What you want . __eou__ Are you absolutely sure there is not already firmware for your device ? __eou__ </d> yeah i tried using the rt2800pci module , it does not work __eou__ i am trying ndiswrapper as last resort __eou__ i saw some people posting the same problem but no real solution __eou__
Ubuntu messes up my wifi after downloading something thru firefox __eou__ </d> something as in anything ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__ </d> amd64 __eou__ What happens ? __eou__ Just disconnects ? __eou__ </d> Noone can use wifi till i restart router again __eou__ It connects just doesn't work __eou__ </d> ... that 's an issue with your router , then . __eou__ </d> How can that be ? __eou__ Only happens on ubuntu __eou__ </d> Routers are computers __eou__ They have bugs __eou__ Ubuntu has its own unique way of connecting and using WiFi __eou__ </d> :/ __eou__

let me just say ubuntu team not updating repos for older versions is lame __eou__ very very very lame __eou__ </d> Thanks for volunteering :) __eou__ </d> just saying you guys want ubuntu to be taken serious yet you don't even update repos , you essentially abandon majority of your users and force them to get latest ubunut __eou__ that 's not reliable and causes many issues being new __eou__ that 's not the way imho __eou__ </d> Windows XP is ! EOL :o __eou__ </d> last few version of ubunut at the very least should have full access to latest repo __eou__ </d> In other words , not to be updated __eou__ </d> windows xp doesn't have this problem , they release service packs __eou__ </d> No they don't __eou__ Not anymore __eou__
hi , can Ubuntu support memory hotplug under VMware ESXi __eou__ </d> I *think* I recall reading that it can , but don't take my word for that . __eou__ </d> I just tried with 10.04 , although esx gave it more memory , it is not recognized until reboot __eou__ </d> I think you need a certain package ; do a regex for esx __eou__
is there anyway i can monitor what is stressing my graphics card ? __eou__ it goes from 33c to 45c randomly __eou__ </d> i dont think 45c is anything to worry about __eou__ </d> i know , but random 10c+ spikes arent normal for desktop use ... dont have this issue in windows __eou__
hey __eou__ i've put lucid-backports in my sources . list but it seems to be ignored __eou__ packages are still " already current version " __eou__ </d> I presume you did " sudo apt-get update " after adding the repo ? __eou__ </d> yeah __eou__ </d> You check what 's available using " apt-cache policy < package-name > " __eou__ </d> ok . not even something like nginx or apache2 seems to be available from backports __eou__ that cant be right __eou__ oh it seems there actually isnt that much __eou__ </d> OpenVZ is a container-based Virtual Machine so what you run is what 's on the host __eou__

A couple of years ago , using a 2TB " green " HDD in linux required that it'd be partitioned in a particular way to avoid extremely bad performance . Is this still the case ? __eou__ </d> I don't think so ... Partitioning shouldn't affect performance whatsoever . __eou__ </d> These new ( as of a couple of years ago , anyway ) used a new block size that meant that ( at the time ) perfomance DID depend on partitioning details . __eou__ Found an answer : " The Linux kernel has had specific support for the alternate sector sizes and offsets used by WD Advanced Format disk drives since version 2.6 . 31 ". So I guess it 's no longer necessary to partition in a particular way . __eou__
hi , can a <unk> 's temperature of 80 celsius be considered safe not because of excess thermal loss but due to poor thermal cooling . The one i am talking about is rated at a max of 175 celsius . Any suggestions ?

If such conditions limit its ' lifespan then i must find other way to cool it down __eou__

Is it an HTML page you are trying to view ? __eou__ </d> yes , but i maybe have a solution , maybe it has to do with the permissions for the folder im trying to use as my web root folder __eou__ </d> Yes , that would be what I was going to suggest . If the web-server is running as the user " www-data " as is usual , then if you want that account to acces files in your home , you need to set the group that owns that directory and its files to " www-data ". So , from a terminal you'd do " chown -R : www-data <unk> " - don't miss out the important colon : before www-data __eou__ </d> that seems like an easy solution :) thx __eou__ still no luck :/ how do i define wich site is the " default " one ? i disabled the ones im not using as recommended in the server guide __eou__ </d> I assumed you'd already linked your home directory by enabling userdir 's in the apache configuration ? __eou__

Linux is very good at keeping text log files of everything that happens . I suggest you look at some of those to see if there are clues as to why the network is disconnecting .

If anyone can give me some advice , I'd appreciate it ; I just had what I think is a HDD failure in my Ubuntu box that I was using as a file server . I pulled the drive , and tried to read it on a windows box with a USB HDD reader to no avail . Just loaded 12.04 onto a new HDD in the Ubuntu box , and tried reading the old HDD ( once again with USB HDD reader ) and I'm only able to see 255MB worth of __eou__ space on the old drive . Gnome and some other Ubuntu stuff is on there , but I can't see any of the files that I was saving to that drive . Any good way ( program ? ) to use to try to access the data ? If it helps , the failure message I was getting with the old Ubuntu/Drive setup was a Kernel Panic - Not Syncing errror . __eou__ </d> I believe that there is a data recovery program called TestDisk , that you might want to try . __eou__ </d> Thank <unk> start doing some research on that right now . __eou__

your failed boot problem is probably because the CPU is old and does not support PAE ( processor address extensions ) ... Ubuntu only ships PAE kernels now ... you'd need to install the mini ISO ( which is , we believe , the only ISO with the non-PAE kernel in it ) __eou__ </d> ah thats sounds rigt , i search an non PAE iso __eou__ </d> We had it earlier and I couldn't find any definitive information , but several reports of non-PAE apparently booting using that mini iso __eou__ Correct __eou__

I have never done anything like that , but have you considered using virtual environments for each one - shared core tools , but a separate path for each language installed in e.g. your home folder or /usr/local . You enter each environment with a command ( that you could put into a script ) like export PATH =/ <unk> : $PATH && cd /home/projects/java/ __eou__ or chroots __eou__ </d> its the depencies of packages that become the problem . If i try to install something i cant because i have the wrong version of something else etc __eou__ </d> I see . So the only solution is to have both installed in separate ways , yes ? __eou__ so that e.g. a specific java dependency is one version and the one that c++ needs is another version __eou__ </d> that 's what i think will work best . And virtual machines are relatively easy to work with __eou__ </d> chroot isn't a bad idea there either , though others may know better . Since if it 's virtual machines you'll be installing a ton of packages anyways . __eou__ and you can also write little bash scripts to make entering e.g. the java chroot easy __eou__ </d> hopefully it will be one-time-only installation of packages , so i wouldnt mind . I was just interested if any had done something entirely different __eou__
hey , I'm trying to install the proprietary AMD graphics drivers on my laptop ( the ones ATI , not the package manager version) .

None of it seems to enable openGL on the main screen/display . __eou__ </d> You accidentally a word . But why not the repo version ? __eou__ </d> I did accidentally a word .

I am having problems with several development environments on top of each other ( avr , opencv , ros , c++ , java etc) , so i would like a way to seperate them . I was thinking of running all development environments through an instance in virtual box , sharing workspaces to the actual computer through ubuntu one ( for backup purposes ) and then use the actual computer to all other things . Any ideas or thoughts about this ? __eou__ </d> Likely won't work . VirtualBox uses shared folders as networked drives ( I think it 's samba ) and you may run into many problems when trying to execute stuff from them __eou__ </d> i dont mean to actual use the ubuntu one folders as workspaces , but using it to share it when i need to backup __eou__ i have a few friends who uses this methods on their macs , which seems to work very nice __eou__

Hi , is there any way to make an ssh session persist over different wireless connections ? Currently , if I open an SSH session while connected to wireless network A , then disconnect and connect to network B , the session hangs , but if I then disconnect from B and reconnect to A , it 's responsive again . __eou__ I move around a lot with my laptop , so this is not ideal . __eou__ </d> check out screen , tmux and byobu __eou__ </d> I've used screen before . Can you explain how screen ( or tmux ) with byobu will solve this problem ? __eou__ </d> not clear on your details . i ssh back to a server and my sessions continue . using it now .. __eou__ </d> Say I'm connected to wifi at home and open an ssh session . I disconnect from the wifi network , close my laptop and move to my office , then reconnect to my office 's wireless network . The ssh session does not respond ( the terminal hangs) . Then when I come home later and reconnect to my home wifi , it responds again . __eou__ I would like to be able to continue using the same ssh session that I started at home , at work , and vice versa . __eou__ </d> what ssh client is doing that ? mine disconnect when i move to the other networks __eou__
My computer is randomly powering off when running linux , but is rock stable on windows . Any suggestions on what to look for ? __eou__ </d> might be worth checking the log file , /var/log/kern . log for clues __eou__ </d> Will do , thanks . Given how fast everything dies , im not sure if it would have time to write to the log . __eou__ Minimec : it acts like i just pulled the power cord out of it . Then it immediately starts POSTing __eou__ </d> agreed ... but there might be some precursor indications __eou__ That sounds rather like a voltate regulator fault , from my experience __eou__ could it be that cooling isn't operating when using linux and the overheat thermal cutout operates ? __eou__ </d> thats what I would think as well , but ive spent the last few weeks gaming pretty heavily on windows . Id imagine if it was a power/hardware problem the issue would have poped up on windows . __eou__ Kk , lessing thru kern . log now __eou__ </d> not if the linus side isn't correctly controlling the thermal properties ... not backing off the CPU core speeds , not operating the fans __eou__ it 's not unknown ... used to be pretty common on laptops couple years ago __eou__ </d> aye , not sure how to check those things in linux . Any suggestions ? __eou__

OpenSSH client , I guess . __eou__ s/why a/why/ __eou__ </d> it 's perfectly possible . Once you've connected , start a " screen " session and carry on as normal . When you want to leave , detach from the terminal using Ctrl+A d then on another PC establish a fresh SSH connection and do " screen -r " __eou__ " screen " allows you to detach and reattach to a terminal and it keeps processes running in the meantime __eou__ </d> That works for many cases but is not perfect , e.g. if I'm editing a file locally over SSH ( so I can use an X-friendly editor) , and don't want to have to close the file an reopen it when moving networks . __eou__ </d> hmmm , well , change your method of operation and then it becomes possible __eou__ </d> Yes , I will :) I'm currently wondering about the technical details of why the SSH session itself cannot persist when I switch networks . Any idea ? __eou__ </d> why not combine it with rsync so you can work on a local copy , then when you reconnect rsync the local version to the remote host ? __eou__ because it 's an encrypted point-to-point link . __eou__ </d> well , because then I have an extra step ( rsync) , and I may be editing dozens of files at a time in different directory trees . __eou__
Hrm , where do I find sha256 sums of the isos ? __eou__ Or something stronger than MD5 at least . __eou__ </d> http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/SHA256SUMS ( or substitute for the release you want ) __eou__ </d> thanks . __eou__ can you find those if you navigate from the main page of ubuntu.com ? __eou__ </d> perhaps , but I don't know how __eou__
if i'm running a personal web server that would be nice if it stays active but not a huge disaster if it goes down , is it worth using unattended-upgrades for automatically updating ? if so , should i just go for security or for both security and regular updates ? __eou__ </d> Not sure exactly what you're asking , but updates aren't gonna kill a webserver . __eou__ </d> and regular updates ? __eou__

?? ubuntu uses a2dp as default for bluetooth audio . I don't know what exactly you want to do , but if you connect a bluetooth headset to ubuntu , you get a2dp and you can manage the output in the volume control setttings . __eou__ </d> i want to essentially use my computer as the bluetooth headset with my phone receiving the audio as a2dp , so i can use my headset to make calls . __eou__ </d> So you want to create a new audio device on your computer , and the phone should see that one as normal bluetooth audio device , on which you can connect to ? Is that correct ? __eou__ </d> yes . well , not create a new output device as much as essentially turn my desktop 's audio input and output into a handsfree setup . __eou__ </d> I guess you will have to create something like a ' bluetooth audio reciever'. Otherwise your phone will not see the computer as audio device I guess . __eou__ I would look for something like this ... http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-1464189.html __eou__

if you don't have ip forwarding on , I think you might need to specify the IP address of that same interface , not 127.0 . 0.1 __eou__ see the REDIRECT target __eou__ </d> thanks for coming in to help __eou__ actually , I am not sure what I am not doing right , infact I am not sure what is right :) __eou__ </d> how do you mean ? __eou__ </d> what I want is to have DNS UDP packets routed to some port say 9876 __eou__ </d> routed how or why ? __eou__ so far it still sounds like you want the REDIRECT target . __eou__ </d> to be precise , I would want to have the packets from the DNS servers , I mean the packets whose DNS query has been anwered , not the packets from my system requesting for DNS service via port 53 , if you know what I mean __eou__ yea its definately redirect __eou__ I guess __eou__ </d> do you need to grab packets *not* intended for your machine ? __eou__ </d> sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp -- dport domain -j DNAT -- <unk> 127.0 . 0.1 : 9876 , I am using that , but that gets the packets from my system headed for DNS Server , what I want is to get the packets from the DNS server to my machine __eou__ </d> ah , you need to do it in POSTROUTING __eou__ erm , PREROUTING __eou__ </d> thanks , we are getting somewhere __eou__ so I am completely unfamiliar with DNS and I would appreciate your assistance __eou__ mind for a PM ? __eou__ sorry , I meant unfamiliar with iptables and port forwarding or whatever .... __eou__ /msg hi __eou__ </d> you also want -- sport I think __eou__ </d> so , if you were to acomplish what I'm looking to accomplish , how would you go about it ? __eou__ </d> that iptables rule needs a few modifications __eou__
hey guys . i had a 11.10 install that was upgraded to 12.04 , and gnome-panel or fallback was installed . after 12.04 , i don't have any borders on my windows __eou__ so i can't close , minimize , etc . i removed and reinstalled gnome-panel , to no avail . any ideas ? __eou__ </d> something might have got screwed up in the upgrade __eou__ </d> i already scolded him :P __eou__ </d> the best and easiest way is to backup your data and just format and reinstall __eou__ </d> sorry a format/reinstall is not an option right now . __eou__ </d> i always try to avoid upgrading in place you can always get weird little issues like this __eou__ </d> i know . i wish upgrades went smooth , but they never seem to ... __eou__

why cant i make my ubuntu start at IP 192.168 . 1.3 it always starts at 192.168 . 1.4 ? __eou__ </d> if it 's DHCP then your DHCP server determines your IP __eou__ if you want a static IP , configure it manually . __eou__ ohhhh you probably had your MAC address change __eou__ why not just make a static IP on the client instead of worrying about the router ? __eou__ </d> doesent that mean I edit the interfaces file telling it to use . 3 instead of . 4 ? __eou__ </d> i would move it . 100+ for DHCP . __eou__ do you have the exact router make & model ? i might be able to find a walkthru __eou__ </d> THOMSON ST585v6 __eou__ </d> got it . give me a minute . __eou__ </d> ok thanks man __eou__ yeahh tell me about it , it 's just some stupid default router I get from the ISP __eou__ </d> you might have to burn that thing and buy your own . __eou__ can i PM you __eou__ http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database/ __eou__ </d> you still there ? __eou__ </d> yea what 's up ? did i break everything ? :) __eou__ </d> man you screwed that router man __eou__ nah just joking __eou__ </d> lol don't mess with me like that ! :P __eou__ </d> but that freaking router wont accept my new DHCP pool - . - __eou__ lol sorry I wont :D __eou__ </d> back to pm ? __eou__ </d> yeah sure __eou__

Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64 . I did the software update thing yesterday and turned the pc off because they were planning on cutting power this morning . Then when I started it again I got sent to busybox , and I don't know what to do . __eou__ </d> you shut it off in the middle of updating __eou__ </d> pretty sure I didn't, but I guess it 's possible __eou__ </d> your basically sol __eou__ try running fsck __eou__ unless your expecting to get a cl ? __eou__ </d> i'm expecting to start gnome :) __eou__ but now that you mention it i think this happened once before and i solved it with fsck , almost messed it up in the process too so i think i'll check the logs and see if i find anything useful there :) __eou__ </d> you may have a wonky hard drive __eou__ im assuming your using ext file system ? __eou__ </d> i'm using ext4 and for some reason it started just fine now ! this morning i got busybox twice , even in recovery mode , now I went straight into Gnome . Odd ! Thanks for the help though __eou__ </d> im leaning towards hard drive issue __eou__ backup your data __eou__ im checking to see if spinrite will see ext but im not sure __eou__ my guess would be no __eou__ how old is the computer ? __eou__ </d> I got everything important backed up but I'll double check . The oldest hard drive has been powered on almost 5 years __eou__ </d> my advice would be replace the drive __eou__ </d> based on 4 bad sectors ? everything looks good apart from that . 675 power cycles , 4 , 9 years powered on but everything has a green little dot except for those 4 sectors . __eou__ </d> based on what ? are you running some sort of hard drive program ? like spinrite ? __eou__ </d> based on the SMART data . I'm running the self-test in Ubuntus disk-utility now . __eou__ ah , well I'll make sure my backups are proper and when it dies I won't have anything to worry about :) __eou__ </d> is a user deadmund __eou__ i would trust something like spinrite __eou__ actually i would only trust spinrite __eou__
what ? __eou__ </d> linux mint is even more usable and I dare say .... prettier ! __eou__ </d> I see __eou__ but didn't it come out after ubuntu ? __eou__ </d> oh , yes . Quite a bit after .

ON a machine like that updates in the background should be insignificant __eou__ Probs give it at least 1Gb if not 4 __eou__ </d> I think I have 512MB base memory and that might be the problem __eou__ </d> that is the problem ! __eou__ rather , that is definitely A problem . __eou__ </d> oh you're swedish too ? ok I'll check that and increase the base memory from 512 to 1024 MB __eou__ </d> I am not Swedish but I am flattered by the ' compliment ' if it is one __eou__ </d> sure why not __eou__ it seems I have to stop the VM to change the SSD setting ... so see you later __eou__ </d> haha __eou__ yep __eou__

why cant i make my ubuntu start at IP 192.168 . 1.3 it always starts at 192.168 . 1.4 ? __eou__ </d> ... or tell your router to assign your favorite ip to the MAC address of your NIC . __eou__ is the address 192.168 . 1.3 within the dhcp pool that your router uses ? __eou__ </d> yes , my router is <unk> . <unk> on the 192.168 . 1 . * range __eou__ </d> you should choose one that is outside the DHCP pool __eou__ Do you know where the pool is ? __eou__ If not , log into your router 's config and see __eou__ Many routers allow you to assign static IPs for your PCs . __eou__ the netmask <unk> . <unk> tells you that your subnet is from 192.168 . 1.1 to 192.168 . <unk> __eou__ Are you sure you got the MAC address correct ? __eou__ </d> I cant find the place to change the MAC i'm using some stupid router from speedtouch __eou__ </d> Some routers do not have the option to set " Static <unk> ". It may be that the lease just never runs out . In that case , you could move the dhcp pool up a little , ( if the dhcp pool is from 192.168 . 1.2 - 192.168 . 1.50 , you could move it to 192.168 . 1.4 - 192.168 . 1.54 ) , and then just set your PC to static IP of 192.168 . 1.3 .' __eou__ That was just an example , ( I do not know where the pool really is) , so ... __eou__ </d> I belive that the router uses from 1 to 254 by default __eou__ </d> so just move it from 4 to 254 __eou__ But routers do not usually use the entire subnet for the DHCP pool . ( You may be confusing " subnet " with " DHCP pool ". __eou__ </d> the networking isint my strong side i'll admit to that , but i'm pretty sure I can make my PC use what ever number from 192.168 . 1.1 to 192.168 . <unk> ( 254 is the router ) __eou__ </d> And it may not even use the term " DHCP pool ", it may only have entries for " Start IP Address " and " End IP Address " ( or Maximum DHCP users) , or something to that effect . __eou__ You can set your PC to a static IP of 192.168 . 1.3 but if it is inside the DHCP pool , be aware that someday you may have an IP conflict if your router assigns that IP to another NIC . ( That is why I keep telling you to pick an IP address that is outside the DHCP pool) . __eou__ </d> yeah sorry for that :/ but somehow I cant see anywhere information about DHCP pool or anything of that sort . __eou__

dd-wrt is amazing __eou__ some routers are difficult to setup tho ... there 's varying levels of support . __eou__ indeed . my 600n was easy peasy . this 54g is awful tho . just depends on the version . some have less memory , etc __eou__ i already linked it ;) __eou__ <unk> , so the NAS is a set-top box ? __eou__ </d> NAS = Network Attached Storage -- network RAID1 hard drive . __eou__ </d> NAS is really vague . it doesn't necessarily mean exactly that . __eou__ if your files are on the NAS , I don't see why you need Samba on your Ubuntu box .

oerheks : didn't work too __eou__ </d> I just start reading your question . So you want to create a 6GB swap file ? You could also use ' dd ' for that . The command would besomthing like : sudo dd if =/ dev/zero of =/ <unk> . swap bs=1M count=6144 That would create a 6GB file in /mnt . You would then have to add that one in your /etc/fstab __eou__ </d> thank you so much for answering me but I am very new here and need step by step help , so the case is that I am on ubuntu live on my flash bootable drive and I want to make swap file on my main hard disk to be able to hibernate so is this possible ? __eou__ </d> This is possible . You would have to mount the partition you want to use for the swap file first . What file system would that partition use ? ext4 or ntfs ? __eou__ </d> it 's ntfs with windows 7 on it __eou__ I just want to use 6g of it as my swap file for my live ubuntu system without any problems for windows 7 sys __eou__ </d> First create a folder , where you want to mount that partition to . For example : sudo mkdir -p /media/win7 ( -- > new folder win7 in /media ) __eou__ </d> arrrghh : I am not sure I understand you , I don't want to make a partition swap just swap file !!! __eou__ </d> then you have to check how ubuntu sees that partiton right now : sudo fdisk -l ( -- > will list all available partitions ) __eou__ </d> my main hard disk is alrady monted to ubuntu __eou__ and I made folder on it which I want to add the sawp file inside it with this name : ubuntu live drive program files __eou__ </d> So you would have something in /media . What is the exact name of that partition ? __eou__ </d> /media/309AFD059AFCC87C __eou__ </d> I guess it would be better to do that once manually and add you config and mountpoint to /etc/fstab . Like that it will be the same on every boot . But it might work your way too . __eou__ </d> it 's persistent but I am putting the swap file on my main hard not my flash dirve __eou__ </d> Let 's create that file : sudo dd if =/ dev/zero of =/ <unk> . swap bs=1M count=6144 __eou__ That should create a swap file on your win7 partition . __eou__ </d> I run the command __eou__ just blinking __eou__ </d> It takes time .... __eou__ </d> 1M count=6144 6144+0 records in 6144+0 records out 6442450944 bytes ( 6.4 GB ) copied , 126.436 s , 51.0 MB/s __eou__ here is the result but when I write free I got 0 swap __eou__ </d> Good ;) __eou__

I'm trying to dualboot Ubuntu and Arch , and i'm really confused as to how to partition my HDD to do so - I've never had a dual boot before , any help ? __eou__ </d> Can you ask a more specific question ? __eou__ I can help . __eou__ </d> Sure __eou__ </d> Each distro will have a set of mount points . These are pointers to partitions . Each distro needs some mountpoints to boot ( specifically / and swap) . Some partitions can be used by more than one distro ( swap) . Some cannot . The whole thing becomes more complicated if you have a separate /home) . __eou__ So on the 120 Gb HDD . You'll need two roots ( one for ubuntu , one for arch) , an optional /home , and a swap . The other hdd you can just partition and make mountpoints in the OS 's later after they're installed __eou__ for example , if you hibernate ubuntu but then boot arch it will probs not boot well or the hibernation will be lost as best __eou__ he 's right about that too __eou__ </d> Okay , I generally powerdown my system when not in use , so that 's okay . So I need to create a root on my 80gb as well ? And Ubuntu wont let me partition with two root labled partitions __eou__ </d> ' root ' is a mountpoint . You should just create one big empty partition on the 80Gb . It is not used as a root partition __eou__ Ubuntu won't let you modify partitions that are mounted and the root partition cannot be unmounted __eou__ </d> Currently I'm running on a live cd , so deleting partitions isn't much of a problem . I'm still confused as to which file system type and mount point to use for the partitions . __eou__
You can share one swap among all distros . __eou__ </d> yes but it breaks hibernation __eou__ </d> ack . but no one forces you to use hibernation ;) __eou__ </d> indeed :) __eou__ </d> NFS3 is as insecure as FTP . __eou__ At least NFS4 using kerberos . __eou__ </d> I agree . __eou__ </d> In that case , SFTP is as secure and much easier . __eou__ </d> sftp is secure I suppose ... __eou__ He only has 1 partition __eou__ ... you are familiar with trees right ? __eou__ </d> Yes . __eou__ </d> /media is in / __eou__ </d> He said that he has a / and some /media/NAS whatsoever . __eou__ </d> oh , separate partition mounted on /media ? __eou__ </d> Thats what he said :) __eou__ </d> Are you sure ? Maybe he can try adding a modeline using xrandr and cvt __eou__ </d> I am pretty sure , yes . __eou__ </d> whoa whoa whoa __eou__ wrong __eou__ He can try to set a new modeline in xrandr __eou__
What I would do is 2 of the same size ext4 partitions for root and then one large ext4 for a shared home partition . Swap at the end . __eou__ My method would be more manual like deadmund said . __eou__ </d> Thats the way I've been trying to set it up , but with not to much luck . __eou__ </d> What are you using to partition ? __eou__ </d> I've got two physical drives . 120gb and a 80gb . I wanted to dual boot ubuntu and arch on the 120 and use my 80gb as storage __eou__
Hey ! I have a question i'm hoping someone could answer : Which distro would run best on a 64MB ram system ? __eou__ </d> I would try something like puppy linux or Damn Small Linux __eou__ </d> I tried Puppy already , it 's kind of <unk> ! ) perhaps it 's the GPU , i'll try DSL ! Thank you ! __eou__
TheMadDrizzle I agree , do that . __eou__ OerHeks I agree . One possible issue . If you install xchat in both distros the same settings file will be used in the home folder and it is likely the settings files are constructed differently . Therefore when Ubuntu xchat writes it 's settings they will appear as nonsense to arch 's xchat and visa-versa __eou__ </d> OerHeks I forgot that Arch uses different versions of programs since it 's rolling . I agree . Oops __eou__ </d> TheMadDrizzle I agree with that __eou__

Your old private key should be preserved . Once you have done that you can copy it over to the other machine . I strongly suggest to make a backup of both key rings for secure and public keys . __eou__

WeeChat responded : " irc : connecting to server <unk> .. irc.ubuntu.com = ! = | irc : unable to set local hostname/IP ; irc.ubuntu.com | irc : reconnecting to server in 10 seconds ...". But WeeChat cannot connect . What is the reason ? I could connect to this address yesterday , and I can connect to #ubuntu on the same computer using XChat though . __eou__ </d> I'm not familiar with this client but after the forward slash , that 's used to denote a channel , not a port . __eou__ A port usually follows after the entire URI , so irc.ubuntu.com/example (+ for ssl)6667 __eou__ </d> I don't think that I need to a add a port number : Yesterday I did not need entering it either . __eou__ </d> Of course you don't, by default it will assign 6667 . __eou__ </d> It is difficult for me to understand you . May be the reason is that my native language is not Englisch . I did not state that " /6667 is the port ." __eou__

I do not have a copy of Windows at present . __eou__

If you're planning to use 4GB on a 64-bit computer or 2GB or less on a 32-bit , I'd probably suggest for you to use swap . __eou__ As firefox + flash player leaks tons of memory , combined with other applications . You could get around that though . __eou__ The only I time I personally touched 2GB is when firefox leaked a gigabyte . __eou__ ( 64-bit on 8GB ) __eou__ Just curious <unk> , how did you average CPU load on idle anyways ? __eou__ </d> I type ' uptime ' into terminal , and it shows me average load . In my past experience with Linux , anything over 1.0 is ' high ' __eou__ </d> I suppose that would be true on a server , but I've never had experience with desktop models . uptime/top doesn't measure average load by just idling though , there could be tons of factors __eou__ I suggest ask the guys at ##linux , tell me what they say . __eou__ </d> thanks __eou__ Is there a trick to getting +v in ##linux ? __eou__ </d> You don't need +v , why ? Just need to be registered . __eou__ </d> Ah . I'd better register then =) __eou__

hi I'm having a difficulty installing ubuntu . I've done it a million times before but this is a strange issue I'm having . My desktop has 2 hard drives ( 1 TB and 2 TB) . The 1 TB hard drive has two partitions one of which has Windows 7 Installed . I cannot see my partitions in the " install " section of the installation process . Can anyone help me ? __eou__ Can anyone help me with partitioning issue for installing ubuntu ? I cannot see my partitions on the ubuntu install :( __eou__ </d> One sec , reading . __eou__ </d> right now it shows 3 things . /dev/sda /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 ntfs 2000396 mb . __eou__ </d> What do you mean ? You can't see any partitions on the 1TB hard-drive ? __eou__ </d> right now it shows 3 things . /dev/sda /dev/sdb and /dev/sdb1 ntfs 2000396 mb . __eou__ I don't know which one is my windows partition and which one is my second partition of my 1 tb hard drive __eou__ I'm going to assume /dev/sdb1 is my second hard drive which is 2 TB in size __eou__ </d> I'm... not sure . /dev/sdb tends to be removable storage , no ? __eou__ </d> I'm not sure . If I go to the Home folder I can see my drives like I do in Windows . I see my 189 GB partition and 811 gb partition of my 1 TB hard drive . I also see my 2 tb hard drive . I want to install ubuntu on my 811 GB hard drive . __eou__ The installer is not telling me the size of the devices so I am not able to differentiate between them . __eou__
Extended ? __eou__ </d> you have 4 primary partitions on that HD , the max allowed __eou__ look closer I see no sdb __eou__ you have sda1 , 2 , 3 and 4 __eou__ </d> Not sure why this has so many partitions ; I haven't created any . I don't think Wubi makes one , though , right ? __eou__ </d> looks like boot partition is sda1 , OEM 's quite often have 4 partitions __eou__ </d> Alright , so do I overwrite sda1 ? __eou__ </d> that is way to small and would crash the boot , is the computer completely backed up=cloned and do you have a install or recovery disc ? __eou__ Yep standard oem install . __eou__ </d> oem ? __eou__ </d> manufacturers install . __eou__
I'm looking at buying the HP ProLiant MicroServer N40L but it doesn't have a display port and I'm not comfortable with using it only through the CLI __eou__ i figured if I can vnc into it ( just from my local network ) then I can manage it like that __eou__ </d> its not recommended to install desktop version on a server ( for server purposes ) __eou__ </d> yea that 's what is giving the error __eou__
Okay , so I went to install Ubuntu on a computer after it had a Wubi install . I uninstalled Wubi , and booted a liveCD . Normally I get an easy-to-use graphical installer , but instead I'm prompted to __eou__ " Select device for bootloader installation " __eou__ Sorry , if anyone responded to my question , I got disconnected briefly . __eou__ Can they repeat it , if they did ? __eou__ </d> I saw it , sec . __eou__ What are the options ? __eou__ </d> I installed Wubi inside Windows , then uninstalled . And the options are : I have a window titled " Installation Type " __eou__ Let me give you a screenshot . Second . __eou__ Here : http://imgur.com/tnix7 __eou__ </d> That interface is for formatting and creating new partitions , if you select one of those disks , it will format and overwrite . __eou__ </d> This just popped up through normal installation . __eou__ </d> Yes , so what 's the problem ? You don't know what to select to install ? __eou__ </d> Indeed . This is not the install screen I've been prompted with before . __eou__ </d> Hit back and see your options . __eou__ There 's three , either one , you write with windows , two overwrite something , or three something else ( this screen ) __eou__ </d> My options are : " Erase disk and install Ubuntu " or " Something <unk> " __eou__ </d> Yes , I don't think it does . If this is a consumer PC , then there could be a couple explanations on why these partitions are there . I'd recommend you go in Windows and figure it out if you're not sure . __eou__ </d> Okay . Hm . __eou__ wilee-nilee : Actually , I'm going to boot Windows and check it out . I'll be right back . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ wilee-nilee : ... so the System partition isn't the bootloader , then ? __eou__ </d> Just check which partition has the boot flag or property set in gparted . __eou__ </d> wilee-nilee : Says the system partition is boot . Is it the bootloader , or something critical to Windows itself ? __eou__ </d> It 's not necessarily critical , you can always change it . But without prior modification , you'll need it to boot into Windows . This would actually be a nice place to write GRUB in . __eou__ </d> wilee-nilee : But I need significant modification to boot Windows from GRUB on that partition , right ? __eou__ wilee-nilee : This smells of an anti-Linux move . __eou__ wilee-nilee : The install is brand new . I don't need anything off of it , so data loss isn't really an issue . __eou__ wilee-nilee : OS loss is , however . Can I redeem the serial number on the bottom of the laptop online for a download of Windows ? __eou__ wilee-nilee : Oh , got it . __eou__ wilee-nilee : ... can I just get rid of HP Tools ? I have no desire for their diagnostics . __eou__ </d> Yes , I suppose . Just don't delete Windows 7 . __eou__ I don't see why not . __eou__
I'll help you in a sec <unk> . __eou__ He 's using the headless version . __eou__ </d> what is this about udev ? __eou__ </d> udev , I believe . __eou__ You could also try psydm which is graphical . __eou__
Hi , is there anyway to find out where Grub is installed ? __eou__ </d> Use locate __eou__ <unk> locate <unk> is a command . __eou__ </d> just " locate grub "? __eou__ </d> yes . __eou__ </d> okay , I ran the command but it doesn't tell me whether it 's on sda or sdb . __eou__ Hi , does anyone here have experience with installing the BURG bootloader ? __eou__ oh hey wilee-nilee ! by the way , I never got the chance to thank you for your extraordinarily help and advice the other day . everything went very well ! __eou__ when I boot up my computer , grub pops up and I can choose between windows and ubuntu . i just tried to install burg but grub still pops up [ wilee-nilee ] __eou__ </d> ' ~$ mount'.

I am running java program as sudo .. still it isnt working __eou__ 2nd option not feasible and already done 1st option .. its not working . __eou__ </d> mh ... I'm not sure there . You could also try setting the setuid bit of the shell script to root , but that 's extremely dangerous . Ask on #linux , they should know more about this topic __eou__

Is there an easy way to make wlan0 have higher priority than eth0 , when it comes to internet connection ? It seems it favors eth0 which is just a LAN , for everything . I'd like everything to go thru wlan0 instead . __eou__ While still being able to connect to other local PCs , of course . __eou__ </d> yes , go to network-manager->eth0->edit connection->ipv4 settings-> routes , add your local networks and check the " only use for these networks " box __eou__ </d> Adding each PC or the gateway ? __eou__ I actually did tick the checkbox earlier , but nothing changed .

I've got a few questions : 1 ) I've just installed archlinux alongside my Ubuntu . Now that arch is installed , and grub loads up , I dont see any options for my prior Ubuntu install .

I dont remember setting a username for root durring my install .. __eou__ </d> if you use ubuntu 's grub , it should display all your linuxes __eou__ if you're asking about the login info for arch , please use #archlinux __eou__ </d> Its the grub for arch that boots . how do I go about switching which grub boots first , ubuntu or arch ? __eou__ </d> ! grub | TheMadDrizzle_ __eou__ you can also presumably just configure arch 's copy of grub appropriately .

Hello all , I created an ext4 partition on my USB harddrive using gparted . Now when I plug it in to Ubuntu 12.04 , I don't have write access . I suspect I can fix this in fstab , but shouldn't any USB drive be mounted by my user by default ? Is there something fundementally wrong with the partition I created ? __eou__ </d> actually , change the mount points permission ... __eou__ fstab is only required for permissions when you use FAT/NTFS ( none native filesystems ) __eou__ </d> I see that my ext4 drive is owned by root in /media . Another random USB drive I plug in ( FAT32 ) is owned by my user . __eou__ </d> if it 's ext4 - change the owner then . __eou__ </d> I did that , and it did remember it when I replugged the drive . So its all good on this computer . But lets say I plug this into another computer ; won't I be able to write to it unless I change the owner ? __eou__ </d> perhaps you should use FAT then ... __eou__
Hi guys .. what is the best method for converting fat32 to ntfs/ext3 file system without data loss __eou__ </d> back up , create fs , copy __eou__ </d> there isnt enough room on my pc to back up my ext __eou__ theres no way to convert without data loss ? __eou__ </d> what do you mean by " ntfs/ext3 " ? __eou__
Hah . wow . __eou__ </d> Did you try to use the standard elo touch driver in 12.04 . I have a forum thread here ( in german) , where someone seems to be using the ' standard ' driver in 12.04 ... __eou__ </d> Which standard elo one ? Could be something i've missed . __eou__ </d> Looks like he has a screen of the C-series http://elotouch.com/Products/Computers/cseries/default.asp __eou__ He is talking about ' the standard ELoTouch Linux driver " __eou__ I guess he uses the one you mention . It could be , that EloTouch did not update the indications about the ' working kernels'. Maybe that driver just works with any Linux kernel after 2.2 ;) __eou__ If you look here , the pre-built drivers stop with 8.04 ... http://www.elotouch.com/Support/Downloads/Linux/dnld_linux.asp __eou__ If I read here http://www.elotouch.com/files/install/Elo-Linux-USB-v3.5.2_Installation-Instructions.txt , it looks like you don't have to compile anything to make the driver work . You need to ' embed it ' into your current installation . Only thing you need is ' <unk> ' and ' libusb ' __eou__ </d> Unless linux would interpret usb -> serial cable as usb instead of serial like windows does .. I'm really not sure . __eou__ and unfortunately the serial drivers come with some c code that needs to be compiled .. but makefiles only exist for kernels 2.4 and 2.6 __eou__ </d> Ok . I see . Indeed it looks like you have to compile <unk> . <unk> kernel modules for the serial driver . That could be a problem . __eou__ </d> I guess I could always try the USB drivers on the off chance that they work . But with needing serial on windows , i suspect this is the same , even with the serial > usb adapter . __eou__ </d> serial > usb is problably correctly recognized as serial port . You can try that yourself . Plug the adapter into the usb port and do ' dmesg ' in a terminal . The last few lines of the output should indicate , how the adapter is recognized by ubuntu , and what /dev/ttySX is used . __eou__ Well ... In that case I would give the USB driver a try . Well I guess it is worth a try . You can only win . And as you don't have to compile anything ... __eou__ </d> I'll try what _TJ_ is saying else I'll try the USB drivers . __eou__

I am trying to use [ <unk> <unk> ] on a new install of Precise . It installs OK , but performance is slow and erratic . __eou__ With [ <unk> ] my array sustains 100MB/s write indefinitely . __eou__ With [ <unk> ] it sustains 100MB/s write indefinitely . __eou__ </d> is the raid array synced already ? __eou__ or rebuilt , i mean __eou__ </d> When I slip dm-crypt into that , it will pull 100MB/s for ~2 seconds , then freeze the machine for ~90 seconds . Then it will pull another 100MB/sec ... <unk> , rinse , repeat . __eou__ Gives an effective throughput of <unk> . __eou__ Has anyone seen that before ? I've been scouring Google/Launchpad/KML/etc for the last three days and haven't run across anything useful . __eou__ Yes . Long since . I built the array and went to bed . Installed the next night . :) __eou__
Does the system use a 32-bit or 64-bit kernel ? __eou__ Almost all of these problems are caused by dm-crypt re-ordering block IOs to an extreme degree ( as shown by <unk> , such that it is very hard for the raid layer to merge them in to full stripes , leading to many extra reads and writes . There are minor problems with losing io_context and seeking for CFQ , but they have far less impact . __eou__ </d> Are there any tuneables to mitigate that ? __eou__ </d> I'm not aware of anything but then again I've never really needed it so not looked __eou__ </d> I saw the same behavior with both [ <unk> ] and [ <unk> . With the dm-crypt being the top layer , it shouldn't be doing that much reordering should it ? I can see it doing so when it is the third layer .... __eou__ </d> I know that if you encrypt the block devices and then put a file-system on top of them , it'll be faster than a encrypting a file-system on top of block devices . The reason being , the encryption runs in a single thread per block device . __eou__ Can you test it with dmcrypt > RAID > LVM ? __eou__
Minimec / _TJ_ : Yeah , it 's actually listed as /dev/ttyUSB0 . But would that require USB drivers or serial ? As on windows it was serial . __eou__ </d> It you see it there , no driver is required , it 's good to go __eou__ For example , when I use it I do : " screen -L /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> " __eou__ </d> is that for touch screen stuff ? I can certainly try it . __eou__ </d> the /dev/ttyUSB0 is a standard serial device __eou__ it can be opened just the same as /dev/ttyS* devices __eou__ The clue is in the " tty " part of the device name __eou__ And , if I read back correctly and see mention of ELO - you're trying to use it with an ELO touchscreen . I have one right next to me on an external monitor , and I connected it to this PC using my own USB<>serial converter __eou__
for serial to USB converters the device is more often /dev/ttyUSB* __eou__ </d> Interesting ... __eou__ </d> I use one for getting to early boot kernel consoles when testing kernel builds on various hardware __eou__ Famous last words :p __eou__

Intelligent people can adapt easily as the mindsets are identcal and can fix issues __eou__ </d> i use both windows mac and linux __eou__ im talking to you on a macbook pro right now __eou__ </d> how long have you used both ? __eou__ </d> the first modern os i used was mac os __eou__ before that dos __eou__ </d> doesn't answer my question ... __eou__ </d> all im trying to say is its easier for non geeky users to stick with things that are simple __eou__ you can get flash in linux __eou__ </d> not for much longer __eou__ http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/adobe-adandons-flash-on-linux __eou__ its not needed nowadays __eou__ 7 sweeps of data change to delete data __eou__ </d> im paranoid :-P __eou__ you know how MI5 gets rid of data ? __eou__
Does $lineToDelete show enything if you echo it ? __eou__ </d> yes it echos the correct line __eou__ for example if I enter 100 it'll echo 100 if I tell to echo it __eou__ </d> I'm not sure if d is the right thing to to . I would question if if get 's the right line number . __eou__ OK , I got the one with 100 . __eou__ By any chance , if you have any given text file would it delete the line number as given ? __eou__ </d> you need to be onto something there I plain texted a password file and its not working there eithr __eou__ </d> Well , I ran the command as in line 42 . I created a file with six lines . Each line has 0 to 5 counting up . It does not delete anything . Hence my question . __eou__ </d> seems my ? usage of sed is wrong then ? __eou__ </d> That 's what I thought . Also , I'm not convinced it is supposed to delete a specific li number . I might be wrong though . That 's why I did the tiny test with a demo file . __eou__ </d> even just putting sed -n " <unk> ' <unk> . txt into the script doesn't seem to be working and that looks like basic sed syntax __eou__ sed -n 100d Passwords . txt ; cat -n Passwords . txt even just pure from cli isn't working so I guess I am missing something about sed .... __eou__ </d> I know , I try to find out how to do it . __eou__ I'm still not convinced that the li number expression will work . __eou__ There 's a saying that if you have one small problem that you want to solve with regex you end up having two probs , a small one and a big one . __eou__ </d> yeah I had this kinda issue a long time ago with sed with a website that was hacked , and needing to remove the offending code ..... shoul saved that so I could see what was in there __eou__ </d> d seems to be a zero address command . We need to find a way ohw to use address < number > __eou__ You're using version 4.2 . 1 right ? __eou__ </d> got it working basically with sed -i ' 100d ' Passwords . txt so now I guess I can start building back up __eou__ </d> I'm working with -e , then <unk> > __eou__ I guess you'll get on with it now . __eou__ If that fails there 's <unk> . __eou__ </d> that was going to be next try .... awk and sed are commands I havn't used obviously :-( __eou__ </d> Are you there ...? __eou__ I think I got what you need . __eou__ </d> that would be great __eou__
if you want to share files between 2 ubuntu machines I would not use samba l3d . Samba is for sharing linux with windows . __eou__ </d> ubuntu has smbclient which will allow it to access samba shares on ANY OS , it 's not only for WIndows ... __eou__ it works and incorporates with nautilus well . __eou__ as far as I know it will use the system wide settings __eou__ </d> thanks . Apparently it automatically set itself to use a proxy . Weird . __eou__
So .. my server gets offset from NTP servers about 3/4 of a second per day ... Is this by any stretch of the imagination - normal ? __eou__ </d> Not neccessarily . Did you install the second one more recently ? __eou__ </d> install the 2nd what - there 's another NTP ? __eou__
Could you check ls -la /dev/pts and does /var/run/utmp exist ? __eou__ </d> only thing in /dev/pts is " 0 " __eou__ </d> That 's not sufficient and is clearly wrong . That 's why you have it . Out of my curiosity . The error message is a copy/paste ? I wonder if the auther couldn't spell . __eou__ </d> <unk> : ~$ ls -la /dev/pts __eou__ </d> Once you have pastebin that please can I also ask if you mount command shows something like devpts on /dev/pts type devpts ( rw , noexec , nosuid , <unk> , <unk> ? __eou__ </d> how do i check the mount command ? __eou__ </d> You type in mount in a terminal . IT shows you the mounted devices . __eou__ </d> http://pastie.org/4457116 __eou__ </d> I read it . IT is clearly wrong and also wrongly mounted . See my suggestions on how it should look . You mentioned it is a VPS . Given that you have pasted it I assume you have full root access . However , I would suggest you contact the rack space provider . Explain to them that /dev/ptmx isn't properly mounted on /dev/pts and therefore you ran out of pseudo terminals . __eou__ This is how it should look like : devpts on /dev/pts type devpts ( rw , noexec , nosuid , <unk> , <unk> ) __eou__ </d> i think i mounted it last night myself __eou__
http://ps3.jim.sh/sixaxis/usb/ this says that my ps3 controllers should be working withput doing anything because of my kernel version , but it 's not __eou__ the system sees my controller , but the cotroller doesn't do anything __eou__ </d> while I am not familiar with your problem , the page you linked clearly says its out of date - can't that be related ? __eou__ anyway __eou__ can you pastebin the result of dmesg | tail -4 __eou__ nah , just dmesg __eou__ </d> it actually says that <unk> than 2.6 . 21 should works without the patch they provide __eou__
Hiya . How do I edit/restart wpa_supplicant from the command line ? __eou__ I've created wpa_supplicant . conf , but I have no idea how to restart it in ubuntu from the livecd XD __eou__ </d> checkout iwconfig __eou__ </d> I need WPA2 , iwconfig doesn't support that . __eou__ Unless it 's been updated when I didn't realise o.o __eou__ </d> you're maybe right , it 's been a while since i've used it , so networkmanager doesn't work ? __eou__ </d> I have no mouse . I'm only using it as a livecd to get the wireless for my new and New card , so I can install Gentoo . __eou__ Except I have no idea how on earth ubuntu works internally , it feels all wrong XD __eou__ </d> you can use networkmanager from terminal too __eou__ </d> oooh , nice , what 's the command ? networkmanager isn't found __eou__ </d> NetworkManager __eou__ </d> it 's already running ? I tried killall and started it again , but it was reloaded . __eou__ </d> it 's service so service NetworkManager restart ... etc __eou__ but man NetworkManager ... I assume you're more advanced with linux than me if you're going to install gentoo :) __eou__ </d> yeah , I've never used NetworkManager before , I set everything up manually __eou__ </d> I bet you do :) Is your card detected ? __eou__ </d> in ubuntu , yes . The ubuntu live cd has a slightly newer kernel than the gentoo livecd , which is why I need it for wireless . After that I copy gentoo files , then chroot into gentoo anyway . :-) __eou__ </d> <unk> . conf __eou__ </d> argh ! The only thing that should be capital in linux is X :-P __eou__ ( I jest ) __eou__ </d> <unk> , iwconfig wlan0 essid NAME_OF_ACCESS_POINT __eou__ </d> it 's a WPA2 AP , iwconfig doesn't support WPA2 . __eou__
why upgrade , you might brack other things , thats not the way to approach a singlular issue ActionParsnip __eou__ wow ! __eou__ </d> might help with the install issue using an older Xorg and drivers __eou__ </d> putting in a disk and saying upgrade may break other things . opening the cd and cp the drivers and such makes more sense . he might press a wrong button . agree ? __eou__ </d> then upgrade using the web , saves having to upgradethe OS after __eou__
hi __eou__ Is there a simple ( i.e. fast to set up ) ftp server for ubuntu , which allows virtual users to be created ? __eou__ </d> proftpd supports virtual users __eou__ </d> security would be nice , too , but should be the topmost concern in this case __eou__ what do you suggest as replacement ? __eou__
grep -ri thistext * . txt :) __eou__ OUCH . __eou__ </d> ;p __eou__ no that won't work for *all* files - it will miss any that begin with a dot such as . config __eou__ </d> grep -ri thistext . __eou__

Hello ! I'm using gcc version 4.6 . 3 on Ubuntu . Is there a way to access function declaration/syntax/definition offline like the way man allows for any command ? ( I remember using Borland TC++ which had Index , Contents etc .. for reference ) Is there man pages package which contains C standard library <unk> ? __eou__ </d> manpages-dev if I understand you correctly __eou__ </d> Yes , I installed that package . But not sure how to use it __eou__ </d> man function_name __eou__ there are also some pages for the individual headers , man stdio ; man string ; etc __eou__

sorry guys , but how is it possible that i can never report the correct quantity of used RAM that i have ? __eou__ </d> paste the output of free -m __eou__ use pastebin __eou__ well you're usin 1223MB now __eou__ you have to read right ... __eou__ buffer/cache is right row __eou__ you have to learn out how linux uses ram __eou__ BTW you don't need sudo , for free command ... use well sudo __eou__ so in your VM machines you will use vm ram inside VM __eou__ </d> ok , but that would imply that the ram is pre-allocated __eou__ </d> so how much ram do you think uses 15 tab in firefox ?? I think that you cannot see it with precision and it 's just cached __eou__ </d> i've done the same thing on the real HW and the increment was 300megs __eou__ </d> sorry but I cannot find a real issue in there __eou__
What do I need to do to fine missing files on an external drive ? __eou__ find __eou__ Or Find and Recover them ? __eou__ </d> foremost __eou__ testdisk too , but foremost is better IMHO __eou__ </d> I am reading the how to on it now , and can I make the recovery in a clean external disk rather on my little system drive in the notebook I am on ? __eou__ </d> yeah but you need more space __eou__ well you can it 's enough :D __eou__ </d> I thought that it would be ok , but looking for the command line stuff I am going to need to do this , I was working in the Directory of Books Ebooks and Audio Books and apparently pumped it into space perhaps Jupiteer as I don't see the debris on Mars __eou__ does foremost recover mp3 files as a lot of my ebooks are audio ones and those are the most important to me __eou__ can I use -t * . * and recover everything that I have deleted in the past few days on this drive that I want to recover the books on , it would be better if I couls do that as I have lost other stuff in this circle jerk __eou__
http://pastebin.com/d5A9FLii __eou__ of course i'm not using 15 GB of ram right now __eou__ </d> there you go , you are using about 15g , but 14 is cached and will be given back to programs if needed . __eou__ so you are using like 1g or ram only :) __eou__ </d> how is it possible that i'm just using little over 1GB when i've launched 2 VMs that should take 1GB each ? __eou__ if i sum the quantity of ram used by the processes i end up with a greater value __eou__ ok , but i told vmware to preallocate the RAM __eou__ so it should cont as used and not available by the actual HW __eou__ am i wrong ? __eou__ </d> programs can share memory , or perhaps your vms are nicely efficient if they both themselves are using 512m each and have the rest free not claimed from the host os ? __eou__ </d> probably , but apparently i can't get the used ram to increase even if i open like twenty tabs of youtube inside each VMs __eou__ so i tought that was weird __eou__
sorry guys , but how is it possible that i can never report the correct quantity of used RAM that i have ? __eou__ </d> The only possibility is , that you do not know about the existence of the " free -m " command . __eou__ </d> how bout that ? Mem : 15959 15769 189 __eou__

brb __eou__ How 's it going ? __eou__ </d> <unk> : Not sure yet . About to try it . __eou__ <unk> : Can you explain the chmod bit ? Changing it to 0664 comes up invalid mode . I thought that was just three numbers for permissions ? __eou__ Oh .. nevermind i'm being stupid . __eou__ </d> If it doesnt use chmod 644 /etc/X11/xorg . conf __eou__ You need sudo preceeding the commands I gave you . __eou__ </d> Yeah , i was doing it the other way around . Just Me being silly . __eou__ okay .. so with the conf in place .. should i just need to restart for it to take effect ? __eou__ </d> That 's the easiest way . One more thing ... If the xorg . conf has flaws X may not come up . If that happens press the SHIFT key during start up and get to the shell . rename the xorg . conf . __eou__ </d> Everything came up alright . But the thing I was trying didn't seem to work . __eou__ So i'm not really even sure if it 's using that xorg . conf . __eou__ </d> What has been suggested to you ? __eou__ </d> I'm trying to get a touch screen monitor connected . __eou__ </d> OK , shouldn't be a problem . Where did you get the information from ? __eou__
http://pastebin.com/d5A9FLii __eou__ of course i'm not using 15 GB of ram right now __eou__ </d> you are using 1Gb __eou__ 15959 - 14735 = 1223 used RAM __eou__ you are using RAM as cache , itwill be freed if apps are launched __eou__ is it a known bug ? __eou__ have you tried different transfer modes ? __eou__ </d> i don't know what this limit is abot , but i'm pretty sure it 's not a bug __eou__ </d> you may find a PPA but it won't be supported here as it 's a 3rd party kernel __eou__ </d> how is it possible if 3.5 belongs to 12.10 ? __eou__ </d> its a later release , so has a later kernel __eou__ </d> so you suggest me to istall 12.04 rather than upgrade ? __eou__ </d> for me personally , clean install is always ideal ( seen too many issues with upgrades ) __eou__ </d> k thank you :) __eou__ </d> are there bugs reportd ? __eou__ if you make a fresh user , is it ok there ? __eou__ if you make a fresh user , is it ok there ? __eou__ </d> i don't know it just happened __eou__ </d> run : sudo adduser testy set a password for testy , log off and then log in as testy from the login screen .

Maybe just remote desktop , that 's all __eou__
so how does this work ? do I need to be in a queue or something to ask questions ? __eou__ </d> Just ask your question , providing details . __eou__ Did you check what dmesg has to offer ? __eou__ </d> what am I looking for in dmesg ? I don't see anyting related to wlan , MA311 or prism drivers __eou__ </d> YOu can see what devices are detected . That is , even if there is no driver it tells you it what hardware is available .

whats the difference in CPU load for fakeraid vs software raid ? __eou__ yeah and I can mix raid types with software raid __eou__ ie /boot=raid1 /=raid1 swap=raid0 __eou__ thansk Artemis3 __eou__ </d> I hear ZFS is very good to use . I plan on testing it out at some point but right now my raid controller handles all my raid duties instead of the filesystem/fs __eou__ </d> fakeraid hardware raid or true hardware raid __eou__ </d> True hardware raid ( 24 port card ) __eou__ I got my card for a good deal . 350 and I got 4 of the 6 cables with it ;) __eou__ L4D runs smoother and faster on Linux . Valve proved it via steam . __eou__
Don't spread fud . __eou__ </d> i'm not . ubuntu isn't " stable " in either of the computer sences of the term ... that 's " fact " __eou__ </d> What definition of stable would that be then ? __eou__ </d> stable 1 ) non-changing packages 2 ) none crashing ... <unk> > __eou__ </d> Ubuntu seems perfectly stable to me then . __eou__ </d> lol - see debian or rh for a " real " server distro __eou__ </d> Debian is fine , though I tend to strongly advice people against using RH . CentOS is somewhat better , but still a real pita to deal with compared to Ubuntu/Debian . __eou__ RH based server distributions tend to require a lot higher level of knowledge about the inner workings of the system . If you want things to just work , Debian or Ubuntu is simply a lot better choice . And unless you are managing a large number of servers , there simply isn't any advantage *at all* with using RH . __eou__ </d> i'd never personally use rh ... but it 's an enterprise grade OS __eou__
CentOS is free __eou__ </d> but isn't RH and it doesn't has support like RH __eou__ </d> it 's pretty much red hat . __eou__
I never could get use to fedora __eou__ </d> what 's so different ? __eou__ i like fedora because it gets installed very easy with XFCE __eou__ gnome crashes at me i think __eou__ in fact , i never tested on this netbook __eou__ i think i might definitly move to ubuntu __eou__ </d> Not sure , I don't know rpm really and it just felt uncomfortable . Might have to give it another try but in the past I had nothing but hardware problems __eou__ tried : Most likely just bad luck on my part __eou__ </d> hm .. __eou__ don't know what to say __eou__ </d> tried : I'll give it another go now __eou__ been wanting to do a nothing install on empty drive __eou__ </d> i'll check on youtube to see how it works ubuntu on my netbook :) __eou__ </d> Plus the ubuntu community has been more help especially for my Asus Zenbook ... __eou__ lol -- tried : The requested URL <unk> . iso was not found on this server __eou__ </d> :) ) __eou__ fedora doesn't want you __eou__ </d> see bad luck :) __eou__
whats the difference in CPU load for fakeraid vs software raid ? __eou__ </d> fakeraid in linux is not a good idea , to say the least ; even if they had the same cpu usage ; you are better off with soft , for reliability , and portability , or even options __eou__ </d> yeah and I can mix raid types with software raid __eou__ ie /boot=raid1 /=raid1 swap=raid0 __eou__ thansk Artemis3 __eou__ you know what else - I forgot I have mixed drives - two 320bg WD drives but one with 8mb and one with 16mb cache __eou__ this is not a problem with software eaid __eou__ raid __eou__ </d> soft raid is very forgiving , of course you will have reduced performance , but even green drives will work ( albeit slowly , and you should disable that parking stuff lol ) __eou__
I never could get use to fedora __eou__ tried : Most likely just bad luck on my part __eou__ tried : I'll give it another go now __eou__ been wanting to do a nothing install on empty drive __eou__ lol -- tried : The requested URL <unk> . iso was not found on this server __eou__ just a bad mirror going now __eou__ Does anyone here use SublimeText2 ? Is it worth the <unk> ? __eou__ </d> Imho , yes . __eou__ I use it on Mac , Windows , and Linux and it 's my preferred editor in all those environments . __eou__ </d> Is the license good across all os 's __eou__ </d> Yes . __eou__ </d> I have a mac book pro at work , and I use only linux at home __eou__ cool , then I might have to get it __eou__
It 's Ubuntu good as server ? __eou__ </d> Yes . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server __eou__ </d> it has installation features , like .. to be able to not install any DE and so on ? __eou__
fakeraid and software raid are basically the same . I think you mean hardware raid ( where the controller handles all the raid duties ) and fakeraid where the system handles the raid duties __eou__ </d> I used to use something called ifenslave to accomplish teaming , but that was a long time ago __eou__ </d> Alright I will look at ifenslave as well . Thank you __eou__
we speaking about servers __eou__ </d> what about servers ? __eou__ </d> discussion was about choose between debian and ubuntu server __eou__ </d> i believe someone asked about an eeepc surely not a server ;) __eou__ </d> yeah you have to read above .. more above :D __eou__ btw was all OT __eou__ so forget my sentence :D __eou__ </d> you mean your ot talk about debian vs ubuntu ? well we can try this in offtopic :) __eou__ </d> yeah I just said that __eou__ </d> for non support talk please join #ubuntu-offtopic , repeat the question there :) __eou__
anyone know a program like linx for ubuntu ? __eou__ </d> Is it Lynx ? __eou__ </d> a program that allows you to stress test your CPU giving you a value in Gflops __eou__
How does SublimeText2 compare to , say , JEdit ? __eou__ </d> Never tried jedit . __eou__ Given that jedit is written in Java , I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that sublime is probably more snappy . :) __eou__ </d> That 's a safe assumption , yes . __eou__
anyone know a program like linx for ubuntu ? __eou__ </d> you're going to have to describe what linx is __eou__ </d> a program that allows you to stress test your CPU giving you a value in Gflops __eou__ </d> you could just try to compile libreoffice __eou__
What disto do you think is stable more so than Ubuntu , the only one I know is debian stable branch ... __eou__ </d> what i use ;) __eou__ </d> lol ok __eou__ I missed the first half of the discussion are you having an issue ? __eou__
CentOS is free __eou__ </d> And you get no ( Official ) support contracts for CentOS , which means I certainly wouldn't recommend it for " enterprise " use . And then what 's the point ? Using it for the sake of using it ? __eou__ </d> I'm not advocating it 's use , but if you want red hat for some reason , but can't afford the commercial product , use centos __eou__ </d> It 's just that I can't think of any reason why one would want that . Ubuntu just seems like a superior choice as server compared to RH/CentOS in all but some very , very specific cases . __eou__
is there an easy way to check network traffic in terminal ? I just want some basic like % / emgabit used , when I search I only find advanced stuff like packet sniffing , web filtering etc __eou__ </d> iftop __eou__ or iptraf __eou__ </d> thanks __eou__ </d> not at all :) __eou__

Happens all the time . __eou__ Are you losing power or getting disconnected ? __eou__ Do you have an android phone ? if so download wifi analyzer and watch the signal strength on the router . It might be crapping out on you . Can also use that app to find less clogged channels . __eou__ try seeing if you can find an app that will pick up Wireless APs and show their signal strength . __eou__ </d> there doesnt seem to be any problems with the router . __eou__ </d> So the signal strength is staying steady right ? __eou__ </d> the signal strength is nice and steady __eou__ </d> Hrmm have you tried loading a different driver for the wireless ? It shouldn't be dropping the connection if the signal strength is steady . Let me look something up __eou__

The ntop is a big one and requires a daemon to run , btw . __eou__ </d> That explains why it quit . What daemon do I need to run for it ? __eou__ </d> Did you install it ? You are being asked for a password that you later need to attach a client to it . __eou__ I don't have it installed on the system I'm using right now . __eou__ </d> Ok I'll work on it later . Guess I should focus on trying to improve the speed of the R6 array ;) __eou__ </d> Is it for a server , eg many io requests from different users ? __eou__ </d> Home server . will have 10+ devices connecting to it at any given time .

hey all , I need help with ssh client/host config in ubuntu 12.04 . Is there a better channel I should check or can anyone help me out here ? __eou__ ok , I'll give it a go . I was trying to read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys and was getting confused which commands were run on host and which were run on client . __eou__ I wasn't sure how to get the server to recognize a client as an authorized entity and make the connection . __eou__ Correct , cannot connect . Tried copying keys using ssh-copy-id , but no success . __eou__ Created rsa keys on host , then used ssh-copy-id but got Permission denied ( <unk> . __eou__ The home directory is encrypted , but i used the corrective measure described by creating a folder named /etc/ssh/user-name and copied authorized_keys to that folder . __eou__ on the server __eou__ It appears my client machine has an encrypted home directory too since I find . encryptfs ( or something like that ) when I use ls -l in the home directory . __eou__ would that impact my ssh-copy-id though ? __eou__ </d> I know ssh is picky about the permissions on the directory where the keys are stored . the should not be world readable , and I think the default mkdir make it world readable , so double check . __eou__ </d> so that would be chmod 755 ~/ . ssh on the host , or chmod 755 /etc/ssh/user-name on the server ? __eou__ and would that be 755 ? __eou__ </d> sorry , shoud be 750 or even 700 . __eou__ </d> sorry , I meant to type 700 , but my brain shot out 755 by habit . thx , I'll give that a try . So I'm using chmod 700 ~/ . ssh on th host , just for clarification , right ? __eou__ </d> yes , that 's what I have here . Also , do it on the /etc/ssh/user-name dir too . __eou__ If you are still having trouble , you can try to connect with ssh -vv and it may give you some more hints . __eou__ </d> I wouldn't expect ssh to succeed if I can't get the ssh-copy-id to work though , right ? That is where I'm getting the Permission Denied ( publickey ) __eou__ I've adjusted the permissions on the files and folder on the client and host as we discussed , but I'm still getting a permission denied problem . __eou__ I feel like I'm missing something on the server-side . How does the server know it should trust my public key on the client ? What am I missing ? __eou__ </d> Oh , you are getting the permission denied error when running ssh-copy-id ? It 's not that hard to just put your pub key in the authorized-keys file . Just cat key . pub >> ~/ . <unk> __eou__ yes ? __eou__ </d> sry , <unk> . typing __eou__ ok , that 's probably what it is . So I have to copy it over manually then ? I thought that 's what the ssh-copy-id was for , and wasn't sure how the host knew it was a valid addition . I'll have to get a monitor and keyboard hooked back up to the server again . __eou__ </d> No , you'll be good with just ssh access . __eou__ You can use scp . so scp ~/ . <unk> . pub user@ipaddress :/ <unk> . pub __eou__ </d> lol , recieved Permission Denied ( publickey ) again __eou__ </d> Do you not have even password authenticated access to the box then ? __eou__ I guess I was assuming that you did . If not , you'll need the monitor and keyboard . __eou__

ok guys i'm trying to find out my answers ( pretty simple ones i guess ) for two hours . this is frustrating __eou__ </d> What are your questions ? __eou__ That 's not a question . What 's the problem ? I don't get it . __eou__ </d> the question is that i don't know how to do that . i can't paste anything in the home folder and also , i can't find the fonts folder __eou__ </d> YOu probably haven't downloaded a folder but an archive file . What did you use to download the file/folder ? __eou__ </d> indeed , it 's an archive . i've extracted it in a separate folder , i can see now what 's inside of it , but i have to copy two folders in other folders of my system . that i can't do,don't know why and how __eou__ </d> No problem . If you say ' see ' you probably use a file manager that shows you the content of the archive . What we need to do is to extract the archive and copy the <unk> ) to the location that it requires . I assume therefore you know where the downloaded archive is . Can you tell me from where you downloaded conky so I can do the same ? __eou__
I am trying to set up a wifi ad-hoc connection - from this computer to one of my laptops . When I try to set it up on here , I get a " network disconnected " notification or other nonsense . Is this a known bug in Ubuntu 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> use ' Log file viewer ' to check /var/log/syslog for clues __eou__ I have it but I haven't time to investigate yet . Let me get Josh sorted out __eou__ :p __eou__ We could also just reinstall the entire OS :D __eou__ I hate queues :p __eou__ your log file doesn't reveal anything obvious , we'll need to dig further when I return , unless someone else can help in the menatime __eou__ after making bacin and egg sandwich :) __eou__ look for lines in /var/log/syslog that come from " wpa_supplicant " - that 's the process responsible for doing encrypted WiFi connections __eou__ </d> : http://pastebin.com/ezDf9Bph << There 's what I found that looks like errors and such __eou__ If you are back , __eou__ Can you help me real quick ? I'm supposed to be in bed ... __eou__ </d> Did you find any mentions of wpa_supplicant ? __eou__ </d> I didn't know what to cut out or not ... if you need more , I don't mind posting more ... __eou__ Did that post help ? __eou__ </d> Can you tell me what the WiFi device is ? " lspci -nn " would help to begin with assuming it 's a PCI device , not USB __eou__ </d> Funny how I ran lspci a couple min ago __eou__
is linux a valid format of disk ? re : fstab __eou__ ok linux is not a valid file system type __eou__ </d> To find out the file-system used in a partition , use for example " sudo blkid /dev/sdaX " and look at the ' TYPE ' __eou__ </d> i saw type when i ran mount at command . it says it 's ext4 . __eou__

Hi all __eou__ Can anyone give me a hand with some Live Usb trouble I've been having ? Or is this not the place ? __eou__ Attempted to install Ubuntu 12.04 on a thumb drive so that I could live boot it . The terminal instructions on the site didn't work for me so I used Unetbootin , but that creates a bootable USB that works on windows , not Mac , which I wasn't aware of . I'd like to make one that I can boot on my MBP . __eou__ </d> Format the USB in the mac file type and try it . I had a problem with unetbootin in FAT not working on my server but NTFS did . __eou__ </d> You mentionned formatting the usb into mac file type . You meant formatting it into GUID ? __eou__
Hi all __eou__ Can anyone give me a hand with some Live Usb trouble I've been having ? Or is this not the place ? __eou__ </d> state the issue , __eou__ i just dd the iso file . no need to converet __eou__ </d> So dd the . iso over with UDRW or <unk> ? __eou__ I've only been converting because that 's what the instructions on the site said to do . __eou__

I'd like to make one that I can boot on my MBP . __eou__ So GUID ? __eou__ The thing is , Unetbootin states that the created USB won't work on Mac after it 's done installing . __eou__ </d> If I'm not mistaken , you hold down a key when booting from USB on a mac to do it . I'm not a Mac expert though . __eou__ </d> Hold down the Option key to show available startup disks . The usb doesn't show up though . __eou__
Anyone have any ideas on why I can't browse my network on my ubuntu machine but my systems can see and use the shares on it ? __eou__ </d> try entering the smb url directly in nautilus uisng the ip# not hostname ie : smb :/ / 192.168 . 1.100 <unk> __eou__ </d> How do I enter it ? Only thing I could find is search __eou__ </d> ctrl- to see the address bar __eou__ </d> Ctrl - just makes the icons smaller in the window . I'm running Unity __eou__ </d> smb :/ / __eou__ </d> Yeah I did that . Sorry I missed it when retyping it over here . __eou__ </d> findsmb and smbtree commands may show some info also __eou__ </d> Ok I got it by leaving out the directory name . __eou__ </d> your shares dont have spaces in the names ? __eou__ </d> Ok copying from this system to the ubuntu system it is hitting 95MB . So it seems to be when reading from the ubuntu system to the win7 systems . __eou__ That one didn't but I think I found the oops . It was a nested directory so I think I needed the full path . But yeah I just hit <unk> so it isn't a network issue . __eou__
ok , guys ... can someone give me some real help with conky ? or i'm asking too much ? __eou__ </d> depends on the help . conky has a huge amount of info out there on the web __eou__ </d> yeah , a huge amount not for the begginers in linux __eou__

Who uses spreadsheets anyway ? __eou__ ok , it 's because it 's *called* " <unk> Calc " ... I'm a dumbass __eou__ why don't they just call it was it is ? " <unk> Spreadsheet " __eou__ weird , from my systems I have an easy time booting from FAT16 but NTFS is a no go , how new is the Apple product ? __eou__ robots could at least quote me ... o.O __eou__ guessing it was the " apple " keyword then ... __eou__ </d> there was no keyword __eou__ </d> always wanted to make an eggie ... __eou__
are you using your default ISP 's DNS ? i had rather slow loading on alot of sites on my isp 's own . i get better results using Google 's OpenDNS . __eou__ and Draugauth , my bad lspci shows the LAN is also Broadcom based __eou__ ( BCM4401 ) __eou__ ahh ok . __eou__ and yea i've noticed broadcom isnt really OpenSource Friendly that much . __eou__ yes , but Linux malware/viruses arent as Widespread as Windows viruses __eou__ much like the few for Mac OSX , linux ones still need User intervention . __eou__ one cant just " slip " in . __eou__ one question though Draugauth , i got used to debian ( again via my <unk> ) does ubuntu load modules that are listed at boot ? and cc11rocks , ones that spread via exploits in say removable media ? yea stuff like that is somewhat Platform universal . __eou__ Not really in linux ryan1995 , but it never hurts to be safe , __eou__ </d> - That is a possibility , but I was talking about viruses that require no user intervention - the ones that you just go to a website and you are infected with . Called a " drive-by " download __eou__ Yes , ryan1995 ... They use the same technologies that would get infected ... __eou__ Either way ... I currently don't have antivirus on __eou__ </d> yea the versions of ubuntu are just specialised for one spefic WM , Xubuntu is set around XFC , kubuntu around KDE , normal ubuntu around gnome . __eou__ though i see xubuntu is a lil " peppy " on older hardware , __eou__ </d> webupd8 is a VERY reliable ppa manager that I trust ... I tend to be wary of most others if they didn't come from devs __eou__ </d> ( that and i like the XFCE WM , has a verry " <unk> " feel . __eou__ </d> I have webupd8 ppa 's for ( Oracle ) Java , VLC 's ( no longer true , but used to use) , as well as several others ... __eou__
Anyone here a hardware raid user in Ubuntu ? __eou__ </d> what 's the issue ? __eou__ </d> I am able to achieve 200MB writes over the network via 2 systems writing to it but can only get 45-50MB reads over the network via the same 2 systems . __eou__ </d> Is dmcrypt in use ? Are you using NFS for the network ? __eou__ </d> NTFS ( waiting on 5 more HDDs to switch over to <unk> ) didn't install dmcrypt . How can I find out if it is on ? __eou__ </d> dmcrypt would only be if you're using LUKS to encrypt the block devices __eou__ </d> I didn't install LUKS and honestly don't know what it is ;) __eou__ </d> Good ... one less thing to consider ! ... So the file-systems are NTFS ... how are they being shared over the network if not NFS ? Samba ? __eou__ </d> Yes Samba . __eou__ </d> OK ... I think it could be a SMB/CIFS issue __eou__ </d> Any suggestions ? __eou__ </d> I see mentions that sometimes it can be caused by the NICs not being in full-duplex mode as well as other things you can check . Take a look at http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/Samba-HOWTO-Collection/speed.html#id2690952 __eou__ </d> Alright I will check it out . hopefully it will give some tips __eou__ </d> focus on the network link layer ... on both the clients and the server __eou__ </d> But if it was the link layer wouldn't it cause problems both ways ? __eou__ </d> not necessarily ... these things are complex beasts ... at the very least , prove that the network isn't the issue and try to isolate the issue to one side of the link , and then monitor processes i/o performance and so forth __eou__ </d> Well easy test . copy from 1 gaming system to the other ( both have SSD in Raid 0 so can hit 1GB read speeds ) and I got <unk> speeds __eou__ So that would point at something other than the network right ? __eou__

With " nomodeset " it is possible the correct xserver driver for the video adaptor refuses to load and the system falls back to the VESA or framebuffer drivers , both of which can fail to select a valid mode . If you remove " nomodeset " and let the PC boot and get all the way to the GUI log-in ( even if the screen is blank whilst booting ) can you then get correct graphics ? __eou__ </d> i have tried to leave it without nomodeset but after 10 min the screen stays black . __eou__ </d> That 's .... annoying .... ! __eou__ </d> yes and i really want this to work but cant even get the thing to install . iv tried wubi and cd install so far . __eou__ </d> When the PC is at the weird pink-background window , can you get to a virtual terminal ( VT ) using Ctrl+Alt+F1 ? __eou__ </d> i can go try that if i get one what should i do ? i couldnt get a normal terminal using cntrl alt t . __eou__ </d> Terminals come from Ctrl+Alt+F1 through F6 ... you can switch back to GUI from a VT with Alt+F7 ( or sometimes Alt+F8 if VT8 is handling the GUI ) __eou__ </d> ok and if i do get a terminal then what should i do ? __eou__ </d> I'm not sure ... but at least it gives the prospect of digging around in the logs and changing configuration to test it more __eou__

make sure you understand the licensing terms of each program you'd like to develop on __eou__ </d> but The_cog writes that every app is free to use . __eou__ </d> every app is free to use , but there are licensing terms on each program individually that concern exactly the kinds of questions you have about them ( but that 's probably off-topic here anyway ) __eou__ </d> for example when <unk> want to install an application from synaptic , it isnatlls also other houndred depended pacgas to work propely .

Seems like you try to install the nvidia-current from the quantal repos . If you are on 12.10 alpha3 then it would be a bug . If you try to use the quantal driver in precise , it will probably not work . Some info : http://packages.ubuntu.com/en/quantal/xorg-video-abi-12 __eou__ </d> im in precise , but the current version of nvidia driver not work on my laptop __eou__ </d> But using the quantal driver obviously doesn't install .

See if you find some newer nvidia-current driver for your GPU . __eou__ </d> this version is from xorg-edgers ppa ... __eou__ </d> So you probably too the wrong version , or you only tried to install the package , whitout adding the xorg-edgers ppa .

Not to add to the mess of issues swarming around here .. but I've got a server that ( it 's a gen 2 poweredge 2900 ) that is running 12.04 server . The whole system periodically hangs for no real reason . active ssh connections are cut off ( sometimes) , samba shares fall on their face ( until the hang stop) . TTY1 remains clean . The logs show zero indication of anything happening .. What I haven't been able to work out is if it 's every sing __eou__ le service hanging , or the whole system ( but I'm going to go with whole system here , minus tty1 ) ideas ? __eou__ </d> how long do the ' hangs ' typically last ? __eou__ </d> they usually last anywhere from 10 seconds to 30 seconds or so . I should also add that I've gone so far as to wipe the sever and install <unk> same issues out of the box now . __eou__
my work proxy allows me to connect to outside 443 and 80 ports only .
