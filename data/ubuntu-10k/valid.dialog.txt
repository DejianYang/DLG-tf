UPDATE THE TOPIC __eou__ </d> no __eou__ </d> why ? __eou__ </d> because nothing has changed __eou__ </d> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/ __eou__
Should/can PC users the image ubuntu- 12.04 <unk> . iso ? Or is it only for mac ? __eou__ </d> its fine for PCs __eou__ </d> ok , thanks . Whats the difference between ubuntu- 12.04 <unk> . iso and ubuntu- 12.04 <unk> . iso then ? __eou__ </d> more language packs and a bit more I suppose __eou__ </d> thanks for the info . Only me who is missing an i386 release on http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/release/ ? __eou__ </d> may take a few minutes , it 's been like 5 mins since release , after all __eou__
when will update manager offer 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> when the servers can handle it __eou__ I'd advise not updating for a day or so as if the servers lose connection during the upgrade ( while it 's busy ) you'll be in a mess __eou__ </d> does that mean when https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors shows most/all of the servers green ? __eou__
yeah " ubunut " was a long shot guys :D __eou__ http://www.ubunut.com/ <- is this a fake website or what ? __eou__ and that typo actually exists . __eou__ </d> download from http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ __eou__ and use torrent if you can , please __eou__ </d> gonna run the update , i'm not gonna download the whole thing . __eou__
the channel is now muted __eou__ the ubuntu servers are being updated and prepared for the release . it is NOT out until the release manager states so __eou__ anyone posting links or suggesting it 's out when it 's not - will be removed __eou__ </d> well ubuntu.com says its out __eou__ if thats your point , so why restrict the install media to a cd size ? people need more software ! __eou__ </d> because downloading 700mb is the smallest download possible for the base install __eou__ people don't want to download 2.6 GB or 4GB or greater to get something that can be held in 700mb __eou__
ubuntu site doesn't work for me ... __eou__ i just get ' waiting for www.ubuntu.com ...' in my browser ... __eou__ </d> doyou want to download ? __eou__ </d> yes . any link to some usable site will be appreciated :-) __eou__ </d> http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ and use torrent please __eou__ </d> i thought they were going to recommend 64-bit for desktops , but when I managed to access www.ubuntu.com it preferred 32-bit . is 32-bit preferred for desktops ? __eou__ </d> depends of your comp __eou__
! uec __eou__ wonder what uec is __eou__ </d> yes its separate partition - basically 20gb for / and swap ..... and then the rest of the disk /home __eou__ </d> thats doable then __eou__
party hurray __eou__ like i said overcrowded __eou__ can ubuntu get leaked before being officially launched __eou__ hi bazhang __eou__ i read a pdf linux vs windows __eou__ ok fl1bbl3 __eou__ </d> Do you have a link to that PDF ? __eou__ </d> ^ __eou__ </d> If you could upload the file somewhere , I'd like the PDF __eou__
hello , is safe to upgrade ubuntu server 11.10 to 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> well , it won't explode in your face into thousands of burning chunks of PCB __eou__ </d> and what about HDD space , it is gonna be circa the same ? __eou__ </d> it 's going to download a whole bunch of packages so make sure you have some free space __eou__ what does " df -h " say ? __eou__ </d> I have 13G free , but it will clean after upgrade right ? __eou__ </d> if it does install extraneous packages , you can try to remove some manually __eou__ </d> : I have installed PHP from other repository that ubuntu 's and looks like it going to overwrite it , any way to disable this ? __eou__ </d> you should disable the other repository before upgrading __eou__ install the ubuntu version or just remove php altogether __eou__
Is everybody doing a fresh install since everybody is downloading ISO . People don't have faith on dist-upgrade o_O __eou__ </d> Or some people want to start all over because the system is all cluttered with stuff from experimenting . __eou__ </d> That sounds like a fair reason __eou__ </d> But yeah , I do agree that I would prefer a fresh install even if it wasn't cluttered . The reason is if something doesn't work or something goes weird , I can always rule out some bug caused by the upgrade . __eou__ </d> but if you make lot of changes in /etc and other places then ? __eou__ do you use etckeeper ? __eou__ </d> No , i'm actually very noob and just learning linux , and I've already messed with many things . Also , I personalized it in many ways and I just wrote a notepad with things I did , so I can always redo them . Again another reason is just in case some packages break so I won't have to worry about that and rule that possibility out . __eou__ Rather than just bumping into a problem and then some Captain Obvious telling me " Have you done a fresh install ?" __eou__ </d> in that case , that is indeed the best approach . we have all been there __eou__ </d> But keep in mind I have no detailed technical reasons to give you because I'm just learning linux . :) __eou__ </d> As i said we have all been there . Even I used to sit years ago with the live CD . Mess up , wipe out , reinstall . Somehow that cycle is very fast in linux -- totally scary in windows __eou__
hehe Downloading ubuntu i get error : site offline __eou__ lots of dling __eou__ </d> That 's because it 's not out yet . __eou__ </d> hehe yes its out __eou__ refresh mate __eou__ do you need a screenshot ? __eou__ </d> go to ubuntu.com and use the link to download . and you will find that it 404 's __eou__ just chill it wont be long now . __eou__ </d> site is overloaded , not about not released __eou__ </d> Please read ikonia 's statement . __eou__ FACT . __eou__ </d> cheking __eou__ </d> a 404 does not mean an overload .. __eou__ </d> for me not 404 , i have Drupal error site off-line __eou__
upgrading the kernel doesn't necessitate a reboot though __eou__ </d> yes it does __eou__ yes it does __eou__ of course you can __eou__ you can have as many kernels installed as you want __eou__ </d> I know __eou__
Why is everyone in such a hurry to upgrade ? __eou__ </d> the thrill of a new beginning , maybe ? __eou__ </d> Yeah , I understand but I'll wait till the smoke clears myself . __eou__
I have little faith in the upgrade process __eou__ </d> why ? I curious . Does it break various packages ? __eou__ </d> I have had issues in the past - yes broken packages , incomplete installation etc . I've been with Ubuntu a long time , perhaps that 's all fixed bu I'm leery . __eou__
hi , is there a torrent url ? __eou__ </d> http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ __eou__ </d> thank you __eou__
<unk> : last three upgrades I've don have been do-release-upgrade with no real problems but I'll be waiting a few days this time __eou__ </d> I too wait for sometime always . somehow breaking production or developments environments is not a good thing __eou__ </d> zactly - I have a long weekend this weekend so I'm happy to try it then and watch the forums for a while first to look for issues __eou__

hi , i installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my vm but the Vmtools couldn't be installed , < unable to mout the disk > ? __eou__ </d> you can upgrade to ext4 and keep all data __eou__ </d> how ? apt-get upgrade ? __eou__
is there truth to that ? __eou__ what are the advantages of 64-bit ? is it any faster ? __eou__ </d> depends what you are doing , for general day-to-day NO . For encoding media / big number crunching - YES . __eou__ </d> but my notebook only has 1Gb , so there isn't any benefit to the increased scope of pointers __eou__
If I add user or make a new profile for a person on my Ubuntu laptop do the drivers and packages I have installed work on the new profile ? __eou__ </d> drivers would yes __eou__ </d> thankyou .... and the packages ( such as flash and MP3 etc) ? __eou__ </d> any packages , will apply to all users as well ( that 's both system wide installed stuff ) __eou__
Can I upgrade Ubuntu just by changing repos in sources . list ? update-manager-core pulls tons of garbage back __eou__ </d> not supported , no __eou__ </d> what ( or how ) exactly will be broken ? __eou__ </d> if you're fairly experienced then you can try but do not be surprised if you need to use a hammer once in a while __eou__ ( i.e. upgrades may fail and you need to resolve dependencies and issues to continue ) __eou__ echo $PATH and see __eou__
is there truth to that ? __eou__ what are the advantages of 64-bit ? is it any faster ? __eou__ ok , thanks guys __eou__ I will update my 32-bit ubuntu , so I guess I would have to do a clean install for the 64-bit version anyhow __eou__ </d> then dont install 64bit :P __eou__ </d> I bought it recently . here in Portugal , most Eee PC notebook only have 1GB __eou__
netbooks circa late 2008 and up tend to be 64 bit __eou__ </d> do you recommend installing the 64-bit version ? __eou__ </d> this might help : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Atom_microprocessors#Netbook_processors_.28sub-notebook.29 __eou__ </d> I was told 64-bit applications requires more memory because pointers are 64-bits __eou__ is there truth to that ? __eou__ what are the advantages of 64-bit ? is it any faster ? __eou__ </d> if you're short on memory then you may prefer to use the 32 bit version __eou__

fix what ? __eou__ if its a mounted folder that you didnt manually mount , its probably in your fstab and will remount when you reboot __eou__ if the current folder is a mounted folder ( e.g. of another partition) , then it'll of course show a different size __eou__ a few days ago 12.04 was beta , zardox __eou__ </d> so it is a status not a different download ? is the rush to update from people with pre- 12.04 ? __eou__ 12.04 crashes all the time , isn't working with my dual display right etc ... was hoping this 4 hours downloading and installing was getting something new . __eou__ </d> idk , im not part of the ubuntu build team . i dont know how often they update the final beta image .. its entirely likely they have updated it since you downloaded your image __eou__ </d> thanks __eou__
from the update manager > settings , change the release type to any release , then check again for an upgrade . __eou__ </d> Now it says " New Ubuntu release 10.10 is available ", but not 12.04 __eou__ </d> right , you must upgrade to 10.10 and the next one until you get the option for 12.04 , but first make sure you update any packages that is shown in the updae manager , then go for the upgrade __eou__ </d> But I was told above that I can to an upgrade to 12.04 directly , and I specifically asked if that was correct .... and if I needed to upgrade to some intermediate release first __eou__ So do I get it right , is an upgrade from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS definitely impossible ? __eou__ </d> oh , right it 's in your case since you're running an LTS . so yes __eou__ </d> But it does not work ... I guess it is because of what Christoph_vW quoted ? __eou__ I have to wait for the point release ? __eou__ </d> if not , then yes as Christoph_vW mentioned above . __eou__
and my boot loader can be a tad fragile ( have WinXP and Win7 on the machine , plus OS X . ) __eou__ I wish apt-get could use torrents . __eou__ and I'd like to seed my cache anyway __eou__ Depends on the modem . __eou__ What modem do you have ? __eou__ </d> Sagem family __eou__ </d> Is that like a CDMA or a UMTS modem ? __eou__ Most popular modems work . __eou__ Just boot up an Ubuntu live CD or USB flash drive , plug in the modem , and see if it 's automagically recognised . __eou__
does anyone have a mac and ubuntu machine ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__ </d> which are you using now ? __eou__ </d> which what ? __eou__ </d> which computer ? __eou__ </d> a macbook pro __eou__ </d> you are using on irc ? __eou__ </d> I'm not using it at this moment , no __eou__ </d> is it worth it if you hate windows and hatee command lines ? __eou__ to use a mac . __eou__ </d> what ? __eou__ </d> which computer do you spend more time configuring the Mac or Linux ? __eou__ </d> on my mac I normally use Mac OS , as that 's one of there reasons I bought a Maciej_W __eou__ up to you __eou__
Hi ! How can I do a do-release-upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 ? it says Checking for a new ubuntu release No new release found __eou__ </d> Christoph_vW no __eou__ do not do that __eou__ do not do do-release-upgrade -d __eou__ </d> Yes , I know about -d ... I don't want to do that ... ;) __eou__ </d> yes there is __eou__ no , you don't __eou__ you are using 10.04 which is LTS __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes __eou__ I don't need any help , I've not asked a question __eou__ sorry that was for tc_busy __eou__ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes __eou__
if they have i mean :) __eou__ Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on __eou__ /dev/sda5 12G 7.5 G 1.6 G 83% / __eou__ apparanly not :) __eou__ i looked at the size and used , not avail . wtf i'll investigate __eou__ *argh* __eou__ idiotic __eou__ if i do df -h . i get 7.3 gigs free __eou__ if i do df -h / i get 1.3 gigs free __eou__ same partition , and i have done a reboot since cleaning . still , this is obviously the encfs , i shoudl be able to find something on google now . i hope __eou__ </d> probably . is mounted __eou__ </d> wouldn't a reboot fix that ? __eou__ </d> fix what ? __eou__ </d> the free space issue i'm having with encfs __eou__ </d> if its a mounted folder that you didnt manually mount , its probably in your fstab and will remount when you reboot __eou__ idk about that i joined towards the end of your issue __eou__
so there is no way to upgrade to 10.04 to 12.04 ? __eou__ I have to upgrade to 11.10 first ? __eou__ right , ikonia ... But then how do I upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 ? http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade describes only updating from 11.10 ... __eou__ </d> it does __eou__ </d> this page : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes does not contain the string 12.04 __eou__ this page : http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/upgrade has only info for upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 __eou__ So I'm asking again : do I need to upgrade to 11.10 first ? __eou__ Is there any way whatsoever to do an upgrade from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS without upgrading to any intermediate release ? __eou__ </d> of course . One second while I load that page . That page certainly contained the information a few hours ago __eou__ use this : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop __eou__
Does anyone know when the AMIs will be updated ? http://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/ __eou__ </d> They're working on it , you may want to hang out in #ubuntu-server if you are waiting on an update . __eou__ </d> Thanks ! __eou__

Hi All ! Congrats with the 12.04 release ! I installed 12.04 Beta 2 a week ago . Will I need to upgrade this to the final 12.04 or is it the same ? __eou__ </d> I think you should upgrade __eou__ </d> Should I upgrade by waiting for the automatical upgrade via the update manager , or should I reinstall ? __eou__
and my boot loader can be a tad fragile ( have WinXP and Win7 on the machine , plus OS X . ) __eou__ I wish apt-get could use torrents . __eou__ </d> You can download the alternate cd to upgrade __eou__ </d> Probably wouldn't help , since the lion 's share of my packages aren't on the alt CD instlal __eou__
I just installed the new 12.04 ... its kind of bugging .. Im running on a Dell Notebook with nVidia <unk> .. I mean ... there are two graphic cards , onboard ( intel ) and nvidia ( gt 540m) .. is there anyone with the same problem ? __eou__ </d> look at bumblebee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee __eou__ </d> thanks .. but now its not identifying my onboard intel graphics .. its saying UNKOWN =\ __eou__ them i think im running unity 2D ... how can i know if my Unity is 2D or 3D ? __eou__

when I installed my first asterisk server , I nuked a 250 GB drive , full with good stuff . __eou__ and this was a time that 250GB was a *lot* of data . __eou__ </d> the reverse is true for me , I'm still lugging around files from my pre-Linux days . __eou__ </d> files are crap , I try and be the leaset dependent on files . there 's only one computer I own that has important files , and backed to so many place that I can't tell them without reading the script . all the other computer , can be nuked on the dime . no tears . __eou__ </d> good to know , but I don't think that has to do with me never nuking all my files because of Linux . :) __eou__ </d> I didnot loose importnat files my self , I nuked them yes , but what was needed , I still have . __eou__

hi , I've this xorg . conf http://pastebin.com/N8SacSFW but on each boot I always get 1024x768 by default . I need to go to System Settings->Display and choose 1680x1050 from the available one and then click Apply . Then it works . Maybe there is something wrong in my xorg . conf , how can I fix it ? Thanks ! p.s : I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and Nouveau driver . __eou__ </d> post /var/log/Xorg . 0 . log to another pastebin , it probably shows what your problem is __eou__ </d> here you have my /var/log/Xorg . 0 . log -- > http://pastebin.com/YxBxaA4t __eou__ you got any idea from my log file ? __eou__ </d> your xorg . conf lacks a " screen " section , in the logfile it says No monitor specified for screen " Default Screen Section ". Using a default monitor configuration . __eou__ </d> oh ... where can I find a xorg . conf example so I can adapt it to my needs ? __eou__ thanks :) __eou__ I wish I could use the Nvidia driver , but it crashes my Xorg so many times ! I get something like 7-8 crashes per day and I really cannot stand it . __eou__ mmm .... no I can't use it , it 's pretty the same I was using when I used Nvidia driver , but too many things change __eou__ do you think that this new xorg . conf will fix my problem http://pastebin.com/nC9dGmqf ? __eou__ ok , I try __eou__ once I login my resolution is set to 1680x1050 , but on LightDM screen I still have 1024x768 , now I'll paste you the new log , wait ... __eou__ here it is http://pastebin.com/8Y6qBg6m __eou__ I can't find any " not found " this time and the resolution is parsed and added ( else I could not have it right now ) the problem is still that is not used by default .... __eou__ </d> in your paste around 16.282 it says Virtual size is 1024x768 ( pitch 0 ) __eou__
I'm having trouble installing 12.04 as a dual boot on my 64bit machine . Can anyone help ? __eou__ </d> what 's the problem ? __eou__ any other details you can tell ? __eou__ </d> what else do you need ? I'm using a vustom built desktop with 8GB of RAM a quad core processor and it 's just hanging on select time zone . I click continue and it just sits there with the busy icon for the mouse . __eou__ </d> the other OS is windows ? __eou__ </d> yeah it 's a dual boot with win7 __eou__ </d> did you ever have a dual boot on that system ? __eou__ </d> a long time ago but I had to do a fresh install of windows because the updates corrupted my system . __eou__ so I formatted everything and started new . __eou__ </d> mm .. so the answer is no , well , that 's a very nasty stage to be stuck at , so , Ubuntu copies the files OK , but never starts installing , correct ? __eou__ </d> that 's correct . I click continue before it finishes copying and just gets stuck with the busy icon for the mouse even though the copying continues . __eou__ after it copies though it just sits and sits and sits . __eou__ </d> nasty stuff , mm .. anything in your Bios that can prevent dual boot ? __eou__ </d> not that I can think of , I was doing it just fine like 6 months ago . Everything is the same as it was then . __eou__ </d> OK , can't nail this one directly , here 's what I would have gone for , had it been my problem : 1 . Is the Media OK ? 2 . Bios settings 3 . Is the Hard drive write proteced in any way __eou__ also , is you HD partitoned , or you're going for Dual boot on the same partitions witn W7 ? __eou__ </d> well the disc I just finished downloading the ISO from torrent linked from the ubuntu site . I haven't changed anything in the BIOS since I last dual booted besides some clock frequencies . As for the HDD I've done a dual boot partition several times before so as far as I can tell it 's not write protected it 's just being a pain in the ass . Maybe I should try writing the file to a disc at a slower speed ? __eou__ </d> maybe , I guess anything goes at this stage , I have my share of bad luck in the past with installs , and I learned that it reaaly depends on *excactly* where the install gets stuck to know - what 's causing it . __eou__ </d> and getting stuck after making the partition and copying files isn't one you're used too ? :P __eou__ </d> also , I'm not sure if ubuntu keeps an install log anywhere , that would have been a dead giveaway to your problem . __eou__ well , yes , happend , it was bad Media . __eou__ </d> I'll just try writing the disc at a slower rate I guess . It 's still stuck on that screen so I'll reset , reformat , and try to reinstall . __eou__ </d> sucks that you use Windows , if you have a machine that you can try and use this media on , you could see if the media is bad . __eou__ also , if you're going the " bad media " router , did you verify the MD5 on this download ? __eou__ route=router __eou__ </d> I didn't verify unfortunately but I figured getting a torrent right from the ubuntu DL page I wouldn't need too > . < __eou__

I would _always_ recommend a backup anyway , but I have done this without issue for many releases . __eou__ </d> backups are not a problem :) Do you do anything else before installing ? I have a feeling that moving everything to a temporary dir and moving it back afterwards would be a good idea ( at least move hidden conf files and stuff in the " standard " directories , <unk> ? = __eou__ </d> I just do a ' mount ' and note , that on my computer , /dev/sda3 is my /home partition .

i can't find any place where " ubuntu alternate " is explained __eou__ </d> What about it do you want to know ? __eou__ </d> what it is ! __eou__ </d> So , the Desktop CD is a LiveCD , that you can install from . The alternate CD is an install CD ( no LiveCD ) its text-based ( text menus ) and installs from packages contained on the CD . It gives you more flexibility with what to install , __eou__ It 's the same installer " experience " as the server CD , and the minimal CD is the alternate CD without the packages . __eou__ </d> not sure i understand it , but on a day like today this is just a curious quibble on my part . not important . :) __eou__ </d> The desktop CD installs by copying the LiveCD image onto your computer ( so it has very little flexibility on what packages ot install) , with the alternate CD , youcan install a GUI , textmode only , only certain packages , etc , etc . __eou__ </d> ah , so like " advanced mode ," thanks ! __eou__ </d> Sure , but it can also be simple ( asking the same questions as the LiveCD) , it just gives you the option of asking more questions __eou__

man ... what a bad decision to try btrfs on / __eou__ there should be some kind of warning __eou__ </d> using non-completed/testing filesystems always seems silly to me . __eou__ </d> i don't understand why it is even an option , particularly for an LTS release __eou__ </d> in the default install ? __eou__ </d> it 's offered as an option ... there are no filesystem options for a fully default install ofc __eou__ </d> ok just checking , i don't remember seeing btrfs offered in 12.04 ( but wasn't sure , didn't check for it ) __eou__ brtfs should be avoided in my opinion , same for zfs on ubuntu __eou__ </d> no stability problems that i've notices do far , but performance with dpkg/apt is terrible __eou__
I've always wondered why somebody would want more than 4GB ram , but now I know why . Running servers , using Digital Audio <unk> , copying files , browsing , and playing a game at the same time is very taxing :P __eou__ </d> i WISH i had way more RAM ( only have 4GB ) __eou__ only if that 32bit cpu supports virtualization can it run 64bit even CLOSE to native . __eou__ </d> I said a 64-bit CPU can run 32-bit Operating Systems , not the other way around :P __eou__ </d> " Also , 32-bit Ubuntu does run on 64-bit computers " __eou__ sorry ! __eou__

It doesn't have a license of its own . __eou__ Then look at what the package depends on and install those individually . __eou__ </d> i want to play mp3 , flash and wmv/avi __eou__ </d> ubuntu-restricted-extras will only install the icedtea plugin , that isn't Oracle 's java . __eou__ </d> di you have ubuntu restricted extras installed or do you install codecs on your own ? __eou__ </d> I use ubuntu restricted extras on my systems . __eou__

Hi __eou__ I'm upgrading from 11.10 to 12.04 and it 's going insanely slowly - transfer rates of 52.7 kB/s - at the moment I'm still " getting new packages ", is it too late to cancel ? would I be better off waiting a few hours and trying again once the initial rush is over ? __eou__ </d> If it takes a long time , or you wait a long time ... what exactly is the difference ? The ability to reboot ? __eou__ </d> hmm , I think it heard you guys - the transfer rate 's shot up to 108 kB/s __eou__ it 's taking an inordinately long time to download the software , so I can't see it installing before the night is out . I upgraded another Ubuntu to 12.04 beta , two days ago , and that only took 2hrs __eou__ I'm just looking to get back to using this machine again __eou__ </d> It was released a few hours ago . you can expect some high volume ... and why cant you use your machine while it is upgrading ? __eou__

If a lot of people are leeching it should be fast __eou__
after DD'ing the 12.04 ISO to a USB stick , I now get " isolinux . bin missing or corrupt . OS not found " any ideas ? __eou__ </d> " technically " you should be using cat not dd to move it to USB - but that 's probably unrelated to your issue . __eou__ </d> same error both ways :( __eou__

Hi there . I just did a fresh install of 12.04 ( 64-bit ) and I'm having issues getting my GTX 550 ti graphics adapter to work . It worked fine in 10.04 . I've tried searching google but I can't find anything relevant . It works when I switch the main adapter to onboard in bios and use the onboard adapter . What do you need to be able to help me get the graphics card working ? __eou__ </d> is that some kind of optimus setup ( switching Graphic Adapters on the fly ) ? __eou__ </d> No . I disabled the PCI-E adapter in bios and am using the onboard adapter . __eou__
hey , i am running ubuntu 12.04 live , from usb stick - it runs quiet well . when i go for full install to HDD will it be much slower ? ( the pc is old'ish, 1 , 6ghz centrino dual core , 2gb ram , tiny nvidia card ) __eou__ </d> from what I've found usb sticks give relatively slow transactions per second . Even less than a hard drive *(unless you are spending >$3 /gb for your stick ) __eou__ so it should be faster __eou__ </d> cool mom will find out later __eou__
Is booting with an encrypted disk and btrfs filesystem supported again in 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> encrypted /home is , and btrfs is ... not sure about together , but i'd assume yes __eou__ </d> I'll have a try and see . I used to work in ubuntu , then some random changes fibered it . __eou__
how hard is it to use multiple graphics cards ? ( I need more screen outputs . ) are there any requirements on the graphics cards , or can I pick two arbitrarily ? ie . will an ati card work with a nvidia card ? __eou__ </d> ati + nvidia = no go __eou__ even only ati is a no-go :' ) __eou__ </d> so what is required to use several graphics cards ? __eou__
Hey folks , was looking for some anecdotal feedback on upgrading from 11.10 . Any big problems or hiccups ? __eou__ </d> I've had problems with an error authenticating some packages on upgrade __eou__ </d> which packages specifically , if you don't mind my asking ? __eou__

i'm fairly certain I'm having hardware issues but not sure where to ask this question so here goes - My computer seems to lock up with my soundcard in it , which is an x-fi elite pro pci ( not pcie ) card , my mobo is an asus sabertooth with uefi bios and my cpu is an zambezi am3+ ..... im using xubuntu 12.04 bets 2 ( ok , yea , I didnt think of it before asking but that could be the problem) , but assuming the beta is not the prob , what could __eou__ it be ? __eou__ </d> Go to the xubuntu channel __eou__ I don't even think canonical maintains their channel anymore __eou__ They're kind of a separate deal now __eou__ </d> ok , I will , but as I said , I think its really hardware , im just wondering specifically what though __eou__ </d> Sorry buddy , I am evidentally full of it __eou__ You should still go to their channel though . Even if it 's a hardware issue , I think they'll be better equipped to help you out __eou__ Specially since we're kind of being flooded in this channel __eou__
I'm sorry if someone has already answered this , but does compiz work on 12.04 ? __eou__ hello people ! just wondering , does compiz not work on 12.04 default or is there another reason it crashes ? I just updated , restarted and got the message that compiz crashed . if I thy to relaunch it it crashes again . :/ __eou__ thanks . I felt all but ignored the last 5 last times I posted . __eou__ </d> I feel your pain , sir . __eou__ </d> I've seen that post so many times . I feel for you . __eou__

I think there are issues with the update manager . I'm running 11.10 btw . any way to enable release update via file editing __eou__ </d> the preferences dialog is hidden in the menus in your panel __eou__ </d> there are no menus on top for the update manager __eou__

Hey people ! Happy Ubuntu day ! i can't make Unity auto-hide in 12.04 LTS though . How is this done ? __eou__ </d> install myunity from software center __eou__ do the post release __eou__ wait what lol . Just install myunity for that __eou__ </d> Logan_ : That wasn't necessary in 11.10 version . __eou__
what does " 2 beeps " mean in non-descript generic prebuilt motherboard language ? __eou__ my guess would be it relates to VGA issues , since I get no picture ... the card used to work fine though __eou__ </d> Have you tried just reseating the card ? __eou__ </d> once __eou__
does the ubuntu software center automatically install 64 bit versions of apps when you are on amd64 ? __eou__ </d> Yes , it does . __eou__ </d> so i can install flash player from the ubuntu software center or from adobe ? __eou__ </d> The Software Center is a better solution for Flash . __eou__ Adobe doesn't provide a . deb file for Flash , and Ubuntu has it packaged . __eou__ So I would recommend just getting it from the Sofware Center , or from Terminal with sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer . __eou__ No problem . :-) __eou__
How do I prevent Ubuntu from overwriting my bootloader whenever it updates Grub or something ? __eou__ </d> why ? __eou__ </d> I use Grub2 installed from Gentoo as my bootloaded , and boot Ubuntu by loading its menu using the configfile grub2 command . __eou__ </d> is gentoo grub legacy ? __eou__ </d> I use gentoo grub2 , so it all works fine . I just added a menu entry that shows up Ubuntu 's boot menu ( configfile command) ; this means that in the boot menu , I have an " Ubuntu " entry which brings me to the Ubuntu boot menu ; it works because Ubuntu uses grub2 too . The only problem is whenever Ubuntu updates , it overwrites the MBR , so it goes straight to the Ubuntu boot menu and I can't boot Gentoo . __eou__ </d> I wondered if there was a conflict with the grub 2 in ubuntu not booting gentoo , grub can probably be locked down in synaptic to not upgrade . __eou__ you just have to install synaptic now . __eou__
hello , I have ubuntu 11.10 32bit server version and I installed alsa . System recognize my sound card and mplayer is also playing music , but it is rattling . Do I have to install also pulseaudio or what could be a problem . I had normal desktop installation before and sound was just fine . __eou__ </d> dont want 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> it 's old Pentium 4 and I would like to use it just for playing videos and mp3s __eou__ </d> 11.10 isnt any better for old hardware then 12.04 . in fact you will probably see better performance with 12.04 __eou__ </d> do you think that installation of 12.04 should solve my problem ? __eou__
That 's not helpful , either . __eou__ </d> He doesn't have to use Ubuntu , and I don __eou__ </d> Yes , but we're supposed to be helping him , not pushing him to another operating system . __eou__ </d> We aren't Canonical employees , and there isn't a competive FOSS market __eou__ </d> If you're not here to help other users , then please don't interact with them . __eou__
check md5s from ANYTHING . __eou__ </d> yeah and that is the name of it . __eou__ </d> grub aside ... you cannot chroot the drive , under any circumstance . Something else goes very wrong during install . __eou__ </d> personally I default to the script it saves the 100 questions . :) __eou__ right user errors on a chroot are common , I suspect that might be the case . __eou__ </d> Exec format error ? afaik this means that the jail does not contain the libraries required to run the bash shell , as the binary exists . __eou__ this indicates to me that the install is fubar __eou__ </d> welcome to my ignore list bro . __eou__ you can turn off IPv6 in the kernel . __eou__
what does " 2 beeps " mean in non-descript generic prebuilt motherboard language ? __eou__ </d> short beeps or long beeps __eou__ </d> short , I think __eou__ I just ran a complete RAM test a while ago __eou__ </d> typically a vga bad beep is one long two short iirc __eou__ is the tool unetbootin ? because you can specify an iso , rather than choosing one of the predefined options which will download whatever you specify __eou__ apt-get install nvidia-current assuming your card isnt 300 years old __eou__ precede that with sudo __eou__ </d> it 's a 9800 GT .... __eou__ phew __eou__ </d> you will need the nvidia driver ... what is the output of lspci -nn | grep VGA __eou__ </d> err , you too __eou__ <unk> : first card is a GTX 670 , second a 570 __eou__ </d> you will probably have better luck with nvidia-current-updates ... but first you need to make sure you do not still have nvidia-current installed . __eou__ </d> this is a fresh live system __eou__
! enter | z3r0d3rp __eou__ ! ccsm | LABcrab __eou__ </d> Dan-The-Man Which driver do i select for my laptop ? It gives me two choices . __eou__ </d> Driver ? What are the choices ? __eou__ </d> One with posterior upgrades , the other without . __eou__ </d> Oh , for your AMD card in Additional Drivers ? __eou__ </d> Dan-The-Man Will this fix the Unity dock not hiding ? __eou__ </d> No , that 's different . Install CCSM or MyUnity , and then you can change the auto-hiding preferences . __eou__ Yes , it was a Canonical decision to make auto-hiding disabled by default in 12.04 . __eou__ </d> And take up more screen real estate ? __eou__ </d> If you want a more extensible " dock ," you can try Docky , for example . __eou__ I recommended CCSM . Install CompizConfig Settings Manager from Ubuntu Software Center . __eou__ </d> That is a scary tool for an average user like some of my friends , but thanks ! :) __eou__
I dont suppose I can ditch the unity launcher in favor of another dock without giving up <unk> ? __eou__ </d> have you looked at gnome 3 ? __eou__ </d> yeah , its actually my usual .. thought I'd give unity a whirl since the hud is rather unique __eou__
Load old linux ? I guess use the alternate iso and try a recovery . That 's a pretty intense error __eou__ </d> I am using older kernel __eou__ </d> Woah . I am not equipped to help __eou__
Does setting up a dual boot do any damage to my hard disk ? I've been dual-booting for years now but never stood still on whether it was safe or not . __eou__ </d> what made you think that was even possible ? __eou__ </d> I remember some minor damage from dual-booting but I think that was on a mac . __eou__
I am seriously impressed by Unity 5 , but I have one question : Why did the team opt to go with Compiz ? Isn't Compiz-Fusion unstable ? __eou__ </d> Because Unity is built on compiz and we've been running with compiz-by-default on desktop installs for a while , its been rather stable for us . __eou__ </d> I thought Compiz was better to be left off if you wanted a truly stable system . __eou__
Okay . __eou__ </d> check the download with the torrent it may clean it up the torrents seem to be running pretty fast right now . __eou__ </d> What ? __eou__ </d> what is your best answer ? __eou__ </d> Best answer to what ? __eou__ </d> you have a bad md5sum , a torrent app will check the iso for finish or needed stuff . __eou__ </d> I finished it a while ago . I'm seeding now . __eou__ Do you know why md5sum would give me a correct hash , but the live drive 's check would not ? __eou__ </d> yes the iso is incorrect it seems from your description __eou__ </d> md5sum says otherwise __eou__ It 's the exact value on the website __eou__ </d> then I miss understood that the sites md5 is correct but the iso is not . __eou__ </d> The iso is correct , according to md5sum . When I boot the iso and do a check , it says it is wrong but does not print the incorrect checksum . __eou__ </d> So what brings you to the channel ? __eou__ </d> You still there ? __eou__ </d> yes . __eou__ </d> Know anything that may help me or are you out of ideas besides finding another iso ? __eou__ </d> not sure really I have never heard of checking the md5 from the alternate , it is a bit confusing the way it looks to me . __eou__ </d> Really ? It 's an option that appears to check the cd-rom , which I assume refers to the iso since I don't have a cd drive . It gave me an md5 checksum error . __eou__ It also gave the end of an address which looked like something from the boot drive . Am I misidentifying it ? __eou__
why am i unable to add-apt-repository on my natty server vps __eou__ ? __eou__ </d> you need the python-software-properties package first . __eou__ </d> ok __eou__

I'm running 10.04 lts and I see no " An upgrade is available " message in the update manager , any ideas on what 's going on ?

apt-get install nvidia-current __eou__ sudo apt-get install nvidia-current __eou__ </d> so you think it 's an issue with the default driver ? __eou__ </d> you might also want to do the reverse of what you have done , and disable the onboard video and run __eou__
does the ubuntu software center automatically install 64 bit versions of apps when you are on amd64 ? __eou__ </d> why yes , yes it does __eou__ I would suggest ubuntu-restricted-extras package __eou__ </d> I don't want that because it installs bad plugins and java ! __eou__
Anyone know how to bring back the " Other user " option in LightDM ? __eou__ I'm on 12.04 __eou__ </d> in <unk> . conf add : greeter-show-manual-login=true __eou__ </d> awesome , thank you much ! :) __eou__

Use another os . __eou__ </d> *competitive __eou__ what has given you the impression that you can tell me what to do ? __eou__ </d> Dude , if you do not enjoy being here don't stay . It 's not complicated at all . You're only being obnoxious and disrupting everyone . __eou__

if I choose to install the server edition it will give me no GIU , right ? and to get one I type : sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop . am I correct ? __eou__ </d> Yes . __eou__ </d> tyvm __eou__ will I get ythe actual server kernel/image if I install server ? __eou__ </d> I have no idea if there is a difference in kernel between the two , so I wouldn't know . __eou__
rsync might be good for backups , maybe ? __eou__ </d> rsync is great for backups . __eou__ to backup an entire partition or hd I recommend clonezilla __eou__ </d> how about dd ? or does that require the resulting image size exactly fit the target hdd size ? __eou__ </d> dd works , but can very easily blow things up . I strongly recommend clonezilla , which will backup over networks or physical devices , with any number of options __eou__ </d> I believe that recent versions of rm catch trying to do rm -r /rootdirectory and won't allow it __eou__
getting alot of corrupt iso 's and wasted dload time someone needs to fix that :) hint hint ... __eou__ </d> use torrents __eou__ could add the torrent , then kil the torrent client . Copy in the file you have then rerun the client . It may repair the file ( or delete it and redownload) . Torrents will go faster as it uses the user base and not the Ubuntu servers which are VERY busy __eou__ </d> not upgrading here so no need for all that just bitching cuz ubuntu wonts ppl to download there defective iso's:) __eou__ </d> never had a bad ISO here , always used torrents . __eou__ </d> you part of the dev team __eou__

hello guys , I just logged in on new one , how do you like new 12.04 ? __eou__ wasnt this one supposed to come with gnome shell preinstalled ? ubuntu is causing questions ;) __eou__ </d> Nope .

I am trying to collect statistical information :D __eou__ </d> I personally use MOG and Google Music for streaming . :-P __eou__

Maybe I misunderstan this whole Dash thing , but is it supposed to be like spotlight for OS X ? I ask because it doesn't detect a lot of apps that I install .. for example , dropbox or sublime text 2 or anything , actually . __eou__ </d> It detects sublime for me . __eou__ </d> is there a place I can configure it to find only what I want it to find ? Right now it finds unrelated things .. " dash " gives me " shut down computer ", for example __eou__ </d> That almost sounds like you are looking at the new dash-like menu instead of the actual dash . __eou__ Did you install sublime from a pap , or did you manually install it ? __eou__
the most ' official ' is ubuntu . the other distros are given free stuff like hosting and other resources . the ' quitting ' of kubuntu was canonical no longer hiring a kubuntu dev __eou__ </d> so they are only ' official ' __eou__ because canonical will host for them ... kk thanks __eou__ </d> yeah and link to them __eou__

Hey guys . Using a console irc client for the first time .

All I know is that it says it can't find display : 0 __eou__ </d> I feel your pain . ATI cards are hard to get working in Linux . Also , I believe I remember someone saying earlier that the proprietary ATI drivers aren't shipped by default with Ubuntu12 . Don't quote me on that . __eou__ There is a default driver that you can use just to get your graphical environment up and running but its performance is bad , so just use it to troubleshoot and get the real drivers working __eou__ </d> Would you happen to know the package name ? Tough to google in console browsers . __eou__ </d> I don't, but I'll look ! __eou__ </d> you're my hero . __eou__

I recently installed 12.04 on my Toshiba Satellite A205 , and when I plug in my USB headset XFCE closes to a terminal screen , last message is Stopping System V runlevel , I don't get any crash reports in /var/crash , can anyone help me figure out what is causing it to crash so that I can either fix it or submit a bug report ? __eou__ </d> what if you boot with it plugged in ? __eou__ </d> it will show the boot splash then kick me to TTY1 __eou__ </d> are you connecting it to a USB hub or direct to the system ? __eou__ </d> I've tried both , same results __eou__ </d> have you tried setting the USB ports to legacy in BIOS ? __eou__ </d> I have not , I'll add that to my list of things to try __eou__
why would you use vesa ? __eou__ <unk> : what card do you have ? __eou__ oops __eou__ </d> he has a radeon 9800 HD __eou__ </d> why not use the radeon driver then ? __eou__ </d> I was just suggesting the most failsafe thing as a start . __eou__ most likely the radeon driver works best long term . __eou__ </d> using the radeon driver is a good idea because it does support KMS ( kernel mode setting ) which happens to detect the resolution for you automatically so then xorg . conf is not needed anymore . __eou__ </d> You're right . __eou__ do you think you could help sintrinsic through that process ? It 's been a while since I had an ATI card __eou__ </d> sure __eou__
can I ask you a question ? __eou__ </d> sure __eou__ </d> you sound busy , I did a cd /media and it only shows a floppy drive , when all I have is a cdrom , but the cdrom does not show up ? __eou__ </d> cdrom stuff won't show up unless you insert a cd __eou__ </d> Inserted a music cd and did a cd /media .... not their . A few months back I tried to install Vitualbox from a cd and did not recognize it then also __eou__ </d> you can check the status of stuff like that in the logfiles . /var/log/messages and /var/log/syslog __eou__
I'm with you on that . I still recommend ubuntu to friends , but I switched to PinguyOS to keep my options open . __eou__ </d> thank you , i will have to look @ OS __eou__ </d> There 's always KDE too - if you're not used to it it will take a little time getting used to it , but it 's very configurable . __eou__ </d> never liked kde personally __eou__ </d> It 's based on Ubuntu 11.04 and is pretty snazzy . __eou__ I tend to toggle back and forth between KDE and Gnome now and again . I usually prefer Gnome , but Gnome3 , Gnome-Shell , and Unity don't really do it for me . __eou__ PinguyOS is Gnome2 , much more what you're probably used it . __eou__ </d> I was able to put the unity luancher bar on a single monitor ... just use CCSM and then go under " ubuntu unity plugin " -> Experimental -> very bottom of the page " launcher monitors " ... change it to primary desktop ... set primary desktop via Nvidia X Server Settings .... __eou__
hi __eou__ i have a 2tb drive and i want to copy all of its contents to a new 3tb drive __eou__ is " cp " the best way to do that ? __eou__ </d> cp or rsync will be fine __eou__ you can use cp -v for verbose so it will keep progress __eou__ </d> " cp " doesn't have a -v parameter that I can figure out how to use -- any other suggestions , or do i have the syntax wrong ? __eou__ </d> cp -v /old/folder /new/folder __eou__ cp -vr /old/folder /new/folder __eou__ </d> when i do that , i get this : <unk> : <unk> cp -v " 30 Rock " " <unk> Rock " __eou__
when i configured the 3G connection , Ubuntu asked for the pin code . After entering the pin code , checking " Remember the pin code " checkbox , and clicking OK , it works . The problem is that NetworkManager still pops up the dialog for the pin code - even thought it *does* enable the 3G connection properly which means that it used the pin code __eou__ </d> are there any bugs reported ? __eou__ </d> apparently https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/704123 but the last comment is " How can I fix this problem on Ubuntu 11.04 ( gnome desktop ) without upgrading to 12.04 ? __eou__
12.04 is buggy ... in the 10 mins I've had it installed , I have already been prompted 3 times to submit 3 different bugs . .... __eou__ </d> its less than 1 day old , what did you expect __eou__ </d> Not complaining , just saying ... Though to answer your question : it 's a _release_ , not an alpha or beta , so I would expect it to not be that buggy ... :) __eou__
I ' ve just downloaded Precise pangolin live cd , but when I fire it up it says that I my internet cable is disconnect and do not connect to the internet .

Perhaps the Devs correct this bug __eou__ </d> 12.04 is officially released .... __eou__

so im on the livecd choosing install ubuntu alongside windows 7 and it brings me to a screen to allocate drive space but the two sizes im allocating arent labeled with ubuntu or windows . does anyone know which is which ? __eou__ </d> i think its ur another drive beside file system from ubuntu and windows __eou__ </d> <unk> weird I hit alt and printscrn to take a screenshot and the labels popped up , the first in ntfs and the 2nd is ubuntu (= __eou__
:) __eou__ </d> then use XFCE , or KDE .... __eou__ Unity is only in ONE of the 4 official variants .... __eou__ </d> both good alternatives I agree . For now I'm sticking with Gnome2 though __eou__ </d> Gnome2 is dead __eou__ </d> that 's both the strength and weakness of open source stuff : nothing is ever truly dead __eou__ </d> true but the Gnome2 forks are not suported here __eou__ young , it 's been around since Natty ... __eou__ </d> It has . And that is very young compared to Gnome , KDE , and even things like Enlightenment . __eou__ </d> or run : echo " blacklist nouveau " | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe . <unk> . conf > /dev/null __eou__
for software as complex as a desktop environment , that 's pretty young __eou__ </d> unity isn't a DE __eou__ </d> still , it requires heavy integration with Gnome and other software , so it does take a while for things to settle __eou__ </d> i guess , but it 's not as young as HUD etc __eou__
unity __eou__ probably the same __eou__ </d> don't ya have 12.10 __eou__ oh rlly Riddell . __eou__ </d> 12.04 is the latest version __eou__
I'm assuming that it 's not possible to upgrade from 11.04 -> 12.04 ( server edition) , would the recommended option be to do a fresh install , or to go 11.04 -> 11.10 -> 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> you cannot go from Natty to Precise in one bound . You will need to do one of the other 2 options . __eou__ I'd go for a clean install of Precise , clean OS a intended with 5 years support __eou__ </d> I think I might just do a fresh install , it 's a home gateway/server box that 's also used for file backups . However , the backups are on a separate partition so I don't have to worry about that __eou__ </d> delete one and make it into an extended partition , then make logical partitions in that __eou__

Hey all - can anyone give me a little bit of help with networking in Ubuntu 11.10 Server ? It is a HP Proliant <unk> , and the ethernet is /directly/ connected to a PS3 .

A manual network restart is required . __eou__ Any ideas ? __eou__ My Google-fu evades me on this one . :( __eou__ </d> network conflict __eou__ maybe the ps3 is not sending a dhcp request __eou__ also if you put the ps3 on a diffrent subnet they will not conflict with both on at the same time __eou__ </d> Yeah , I was thinking about putting the PS3 on another subnet . __eou__ </d> its probly a conflict as you said one goes down with the other on __eou__ </d> Same thing happens when eth0 and PS3 is on a different subnet from WLAN0 , and both have statically assigned IP addresses . __eou__ </d> then the ip is in conflict __eou__ or the dns lol __eou__ acully yea it could be the dns __eou__ </d> But on the network there are only two devices , directly connected to eachother , on that subnet with statically assigned IP addresses . Everything else on another subnet , and works fine . __eou__ I don't think it 's DNS , I can ping IPs withotu a problem . __eou__ </d> then its relly the dns __eou__ </d> Sorry - <unk> . I /can't/ ping IPs . __eou__ </d> been so long sense i did cat 5 by hand __eou__ in ubuntu you can simple say use this amchine as host and it does everythin for ya __eou__ but on a server i assume by hand __eou__ your ip range should also be diffrent __eou__

Went to download Precise , and it recommends the 32 bit version __eou__ </d> no ... you have to choose to download the 64 bit version if you want/need it __eou__ </d> thanks __eou__ I have 4 gigs , so it matters ? __eou__ </d> if the system is less than a few years old and has 4gb of ram , I would go with the 64 bit version ... then again , I've been running 64 bit since 2006 __eou__
Hi everyone . I'm looking to installing Grub2 as boot loader on my Macbook 2 , 1 to start installing 12.04 .

hi ... I'm trying to update to 12.04 , but I've set some packages to " hold " and can't remember which ones ... I have to unset them before updating , but how do I find out which ones are on hold ? __eou__ </d> how about synaptic __eou__ it won't show ? __eou__ under upgradable __eou__ </d> hmmm I never use synaptic , so I don't know .

Went to download Precise , and it recommends the 32 bit version __eou__ </d> its due to the target audience of Ubuntu __eou__ </d> so it does not look at my browser to determine how many bits my processor is ? __eou__
The Following packages will be upgraded : < snip > python-minimal < bunch of other python packages > __eou__ </d> well if your using a diffrent miror maybe it lacks it __eou__ thats known to happon __eou__ </d> Good Point , I think we are pointed at one of the other university 's repo 's thats on Internet2 for speed . I'll try pointing one back at canonical __eou__
ugh __eou__ 10.10 dtw __eou__ ftw I mean __eou__ yeah . __eou__ try installing gnome 3 Endafy __eou__ </d> ill just use Kubuntu __eou__ the new unity is too broken __eou__ </d> 10.10 if you want effects . Most stable OS in existence . __eou__
what are you booted to now ? __eou__ of ? tell me exactly __eou__ follow the chroot here it defaults to . https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot __eou__ </d> I'm not quite done , step 11 fails for me . __eou__ I cannot perform grub-install in the chrooted system __eou__ </d> is this a standard mbr setup ? __eou__ </d> step 7 ? yes __eou__ no , what happened was that Precise 's intallation hung in the last bits , forcing me to reboot . I cannot boot the system , and someone suggested me to reinstall grub __eou__ </d> I wonder if it is more broken then just reinstalling grub will fix . With grub problems I defer to using the bootscript to see whats really going on with some stuff , wont confirm whether grub will actually work though . __eou__
Went to download Precise , and it recommends the 32 bit version __eou__ thanks __eou__ </d> if you dont have more then 3gb of ram its not relly going to matter __eou__ but if you knoe what prosser it is we can tell you . eg all core are 64 but as well as all i serise __eou__ </d> I have 4 gigs , so it matters ? __eou__ </d> if you do lshw and pastbin it we can tell you __eou__ that will tell us aought all your hardware __eou__ sudo lshw __eou__ see i scrolled up around the top and it told me i have a product : AMD <unk> ) Processor 3200+ thats 32bit __eou__ </d> I have the same semporon __eou__
ATI drivers not being installed on hybrid graphic card on HP laptop .. Hybrid Cards - ATI and Intel . All that works is Intel and ATI does not . Any suggestions ? __eou__ </d> turn off intel in bios if possable if not you will need to blacklist it temp __eou__ so it will only use the ati __eou__ hybred switching does not work yet __eou__ </d> I had tried this on suse and debian . Now i have started using ubuntu but I am afraid it would end up like it did on other distros __eou__ </d> if you blacklist the intel it hould load the ati __eou__ </d> should i first install ati catalyst or fglrx ? __eou__ </d> they probly will not install __eou__ the oss driver should get you up and running well enough __eou__ </d> without drivers how is ati suppose to work ? __eou__ </d> pretty mutch all ati cards have open source drivers now __eou__ defently __eou__ once you on th ati cardthe driver should install __eou__ </d> so , the only thing i need to do is blacklist intel . __eou__ </d> switching will ned to be done by hand __eou__ yea that should force it to load the ati in its place __eou__ </d> can you explain a little since i am pretty new to linux __eou__ </d> linux load the first card it sees __eou__ yea if you can turn it off in bios you can skip all this __eou__ </d> i tried blacklisting the Intel card but still the Intel card is loaded __eou__ </d> you try in bios __eou__

I don't seem to have a /boot/grub/menu . lst __eou__ </d> /etc/grub . <unk> & update-grub __eou__ </d> where does it store it , I'd be more comfortable editing the file manually rather than using the script __eou__
where can I find iso 's for old versions ? I need to update some abandon ware from systems as old as 8.04 __eou__ </d> why not just update em all __eou__ </d> exactly . I seem to need sources to do int . __eou__ or is there another way ? __eou__ </d> well there is some legicy repos but upgrading them like that probly will fail __eou__ the alt cds can be used as upgrade cds __eou__ http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/ __eou__ </d> awesome ! __eou__ </d> you can go from lts to lts __eou__ so you dont need every ver up to 12.04 __eou__ </d> that seems like the best approach . __eou__ </d> so those 8.04 can go to 10.04 to 12.04 __eou__ </d> thanks again . __eou__ </d> if they dont all blow up lol __eou__ </d> heh . at least these are all vms so I can snapshot easily . __eou__ </d> why not skip all that fresh install em all __eou__ </d> fear mostly . __eou__ </d> cant they be reinstalled __eou__ </d> sure . __eou__ I suppose part of what I'm doing is procrastination . __eou__ </d> or cheat if there vms __eou__ just make a new vm and copy it over __eou__ with the apps __eou__ you can make a custom installer with the apps you whant oem style __eou__ </d> that might be the right approach . __eou__
is the entire ubuntu community swamped by idiots like me that ruined their computers trying to install the new edition ? __eou__ </d> define ' <unk> and how you went about to do so __eou__ </d> im working on it now , but i deleted a couple of old linux partitions and apparently one of them contained a dual boot screen that was more deeply rooted than i thought it was __eou__

How often does grub probe , just when I call update-grub ? __eou__ I only need a one time entry __eou__ </d> can't you add it to the kernel at grub ? __eou__ </d> remote system __eou__
personally , I'd wait a least 3 months after an LTS goes out before I'd even consider declaring it stable , depending on how the feedback goes .... __eou__ </d> any reason why in particular ? __eou__ </d> gogeta : that 's all great news so far , but sinedeviance asked about ' <unk> and that used to be a pretty high bar ... __eou__ </d> gogeta : well , i'm going to evaluate all three releases and we'll probably roll in whatever works best later this week __eou__
Has anyone manged to install 12.04 from a USB stick ? __eou__ </d> that 's easy . use the easy usb creator . __eou__ </d> <unk> , no matter which utility I use , if I use the integrity check , it fails on the same file every time . I already hashed and verified the ISO __eou__ </d> download the . iso again . __eou__ also , check your disk for errors afterward . __eou__ </d> by checking the disk afterwards , do you mean like chkdsk ? __eou__ </d> if it 's a windows machine , yes . chkdsk /r __eou__ if it 's a linux machine , do fsck . ext4 ( or whatever ext version you use ) on your disk . __eou__ </d> it 's Windows 7 , and FAT32 __eou__ </d> FAT32 ? wtf ? why not NTFS ? __eou__
is there any benefit to having IPv6 enabled ? __eou__ </d> There can be , but it depends on what you want it for . __eou__ </d> well ... it 's enabled by default . Just wondering if it would be good for me to disable it . My ISP isn't providing me with IPv6 atm . __eou__
Hello , I'm having some issues with sftp . I looked over my sshd_config file and its enabled . ssh works fine ... any ideas on what might be wrong ?

Is it possible to hide network locations for a user on my system ? I don't want them to be able to see the Places/Network at all , if possible ... gconf ? chmod ? __eou__ </d> what do you mean by hide network locations ? __eou__ </d> like , when you click " places ," and the " network " folder , we have a bunch of different things to connect <unk> pretty sure none of our clients would be able to connect to them anyways , but I don't even want them to know they are there ( so they don't try ... ) __eou__
facebook I assume __eou__ speaking of which , what 's the unity thing that lets you get facebook notifications on the desktop __eou__ </d> *shudder* you mean gwibber ? __eou__ ' apt-get source packagename ; sudo apt-get build-dep packagename ; __eou__ checkinstall is VERY handy :) __eou__ and what is that suppoed to do ( I don't do random keypresses just because someone on irc said to) . :) __eou__ </d> A unicode-ish box character appears in the search box , says " <unk> " in a box where \n is a newline __eou__ </d> yep , worth I bug report I suppose . __eou__

If I dont want to run unity , what 's the best alternative for gnome interface ? __eou__ gnome-fallback-session ? __eou__ xfce , thanks . __eou__ do i need to apt-get it , <unk> ? __eou__ best way to make a bootable disc is dd if=iso of =/ <unk> ? __eou__ bootable usb* __eou__ </d> yes __eou__ just make absolutely sure you don't typo sdx __eou__ </d> merci , yeah , i did that and i killed my macbook 's efs a while ago __eou__
if i may interject , so is it possible to run the nvidia card ( in the optimus setup ) at all times without a problem ? my laptop is basically always plugged in so battery is not a huge concern of mine __eou__ </d> I don't have enough testers with the optimus chipset to tell you for sure that there is no problem , but we do this for other circumstances where an onboard cannot be shutoff . __eou__ </d> okay , and it just forces the better graphics configuration at all times ? __eou__ </d> I handle all of the auto detection stuff ... so basically if there are two cards , I install appropriate drivers for the second , we generate our own xorg from scratch and I set the BusID . __eou__ </d> okay . sorry , i'm not too great at this stuff . if i just install ubuntu without the proprietary nvidia drivers will it use the better card full-time by default ? __eou__ </d> No . It will almost certainly use the integrated intel . Our project is not standard . __eou__ </d> thank you for the insight and for your patience __eou__ </d> ok if I pm ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__
there are extended partitions you can use to hold additional data __eou__ I tend to use ( 1 ) boot ( 2 ) swap ( 3 ) root ( 4 ) extended ( x1 ) windows ( x2 ) home __eou__ I think .. .. been a while since I've dual booted __eou__ actually ... I think swap was in the extended the last time I tried this __eou__ </d> windows should be primary at least the OS , and no boot partition is needed on a mbr setup . __eou__ put windows on the first partition , easier to fix . __eou__ not sure really . __eou__ the ubuntu and most linux will run in the extended . __eou__ you a conspiracy fan . :) __eou__ </d> not intentionally ... I've just been curious about the switch __eou__
okay so ubuntu still sucks ( thanks unity . ) __eou__ kubutnu time . __eou__ kubuntu even . __eou__ i'm sorry , but canonical did take a huge step back when they introduced unity . i dont like it , nobody in our company likes it , which is why we've been using xubuntu for the last two years __eou__ at least xubuntu is sane . __eou__ </d> If you're so disappointed why do you use it ? __eou__ </d> we don't. that 's exactly the point . __eou__ </d> So why are you here ? Just busting ubuntu 's chops or ??? __eou__ </d> ubuntu is also kubuntu and xubuntu . those are fine in my opinion , if a little rough around the edges . __eou__ my company has been running on ubuntu derivatives ( and servers ) for the past two years . the only thing i have against ubuntu is unity . __eou__
Gah , I hate how Ubuntu always installs GRUB on the wrong disk when you're using a USB stick __eou__ It overwrites the bootloader on the USB stick and blows that up __eou__ </d> never seen it do that ... __eou__ I think the rule was if your cpu supported pae , it used it ... iirc , for 12.04 , non pae is no longer supported __eou__ </d> That 's probably fine then . It is quite old hardware , AMD Athlon XP 3200+ , 1GB DDR RAM __eou__ </d> time to upgrade ? ;) __eou__ </d> I've definitely been wanting to for a while . A little Mini-ITX system would be perfect __eou__ </d> last year overhauled to a nice core2 sandybridge 3.4 GHz setup with 4gb of ram and was surprised by how little power it uses ... only 120 watts when idle and the vast majority of that seems to be the old radeon video card I kept instead of getting a mobo with the integrated intel graphics __eou__ </d> I think anything would be a welcome improvement over an old OEM HP box __eou__ </d> actually , it 's only drawing 103 watts now that I have all of my old rotational disks sleeping __eou__ indeed , hp is terribad __eou__ </d> IO __eou__ I'm not sure I even want to know how much power this thing is using * __eou__ </d> what 's wrong with extended partitions ? __eou__ and you can get a bios machine to boot from gpt __eou__
yeah ... I'm sure linux will run in extended ... I just didn't follow the move to get rid of a boot partition . Kinda seems like its an isolation method that ubuntu / canonical decided to get rid of more than anything else __eou__ =] __eou__ wow ruffleS thats new in 12.04 __eou__ 11.0 X didn't have that issue __eou__ </d> it does now and it is highly annoying __eou__ could you reproduce it ? __eou__ exactly __eou__ i've been trying to find this bug report on launchpad with no luck so far __eou__ </d> think this was fixed in 11.0 x but I've been running gnome-shell there and it acts different __eou__
sorry . i went to the restroom . did we determine if gogeta 's cpu was 64-bit ? __eou__ </d> some where yes but they where athlon64 not septrons __eou__ </d> this will tell you if it 's 32 or 64-bit : cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep clflush\ size __eou__ </d> not always my atom comes up 64 bit with that __eou__ its not 64 it has some 64 support __eou__ the septron was made before 64 bit was thought of __eou__ </d> sorry , i was thinking of the wrong command . it 's getconf LONG_BIT __eou__ </d> 32 on that __eou__ </d> this will tell you also : sudo lshw -C cpu | grep width __eou__
okay so ubuntu still sucks ( thanks unity . ) __eou__ kubutnu time . __eou__ </d> hua __eou__ how is it sucking __eou__ its responsiv and snappy for me __eou__ </d> unity sucks ( still ) and so does gnome-classic ( there 's not even a system tray ffs ! ) __eou__ </d> lo , l you just have to turn it on __eou__ install the app called myunity __eou__ </d> i have to install this on 25 machines . i dont have time to do <unk> , frankly , i shouldn't need to for a " world class operating system " __eou__
how do I make a spec display at the top of the screen ( 12.04 ) ? I have a system monitor thing on my 10.04 machine that displays cpu/ram/swap/system load , trying to figure out how to get that on this machine but the top bar doesn't respond to rightclicks __eou__ </d> if you mean the system monitor applet for the gnome-panel , indicator-multiload is similar for unity , add it to startup applications __eou__ </d> excellent , that provided exactly what I was looking for thank you __eou__

I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 , and after trying to place all of my old fonts into the new install , I am only getting little squares where letters should be . Any ideas ? ( On a separate computer currently to type this ) __eou__ </d> have you rebuilt the fonts cache ? __eou__ </d> I've not heard of this ever before , so probably not . :) __eou__ </d> try sudo fc-cache -f -v __eou__ </d> It has finished running . I suppose a restart would be in order to be most effective ? __eou__ </d> not that I am aware of __eou__ log out/in at grand maximum __eou__ </d> Did a full restart ( I know it 's overkill on Linux , but I figure it 's a sure-fire way , nonetheless to test if something got fixed ) and am experiencing the same problem . __eou__ The plain shell ( <unk> ) displays fine , though , so it may just be an Ubuntu font problem . Is there a sane way to change the font on 12.04 built-in ? ( i.e. Other than GNOME 's " Advanced Settings "? ) __eou__

Im having some issues with my hard drives on 12.04 install , i have four ones , one SSD of 250gb and three SATA of 3TB each , But , installationg its only recognizing the SSD , and one of the SATA .

Maybe im wrong whit this and it does not prove anything . __eou__ </d> i doubt it is connected to nouveau , and yeah , it is weird =) `dmesg` could countain some hints __eou__ </d> Never used dmesg before , newbie here =P , since fidisk and gparted does not shows anything , do you think dmesg will work ? __eou__ Im not on installation proccess right now , back to Win7 to gather some info . __eou__ </d> dmesg shows some of the events related to kernel , hardware and its interaction , it is just a command generally speaking that u type into ur terminal =) __eou__ </d> Yeah , i know , i meant that fdisk and gparted does not seem to be able to <unk> the HDD's, but i can try it . __eou__ i was also thinking on the alternate install CD . __eou__

Hello Everyone . Could someone tell me how to utilize an entire flash drive as a bootable Ubuntu install ? I can't seem to convince Ubuntu to use the whole thing . __eou__ </d> how much is it using and how big is the drive ? __eou__ </d> I just bought a 16 gig USB3 drive that would work perfectly . However , in the past when I've used a 4 or 8 gig drive , the USB creator in Ubuntu only seems to give it just enough space to install . If I try to do updates or add programs , it immediately says it 's out of space , dispite there being room on the drive . __eou__ </d> have you tried increasing the partition size ?

So , I have been disliking unity because I don't like the panel to the side of my monitor , and also , I can't have multiple panels and I use multiple monitors . Has anyone done any of this successfully ? I tried some configuration things I found on Google to supposedly move it from the left to the top , but it just ignored that . Has this gotten better in 12.04 or does it still stink like 11.10 ? I'm using 11.10 but have configured it __eou__ </d> i think 12.04 has the ability to put it on more than one monitor __eou__ </d> can you put it some where other than the left side of the screen ? __eou__ </d> not that i'm aware of __eou__ </d> that stinks . Think about two monitors side by side . You try to rollover the left side of the one on the right to get the menu bar to come up and then change monitors . Too , I just like it at the top with text and not just icons . :-( __eou__ thanks for the info __eou__ </d> i don't have 2 monitors , but i think they have or are including the ability to have the launcher on the opposite side on the " other " monitor __eou__ i follow omgubuntu.co.uk on Google+ , see lots of articles I never have a reason to try , but I remember them a bit ;) __eou__ </d> yep , spent a lot of time with those things .

Will have to manually update Grub2 , search google for grub rescue and you should find a doc about how to so it from the Live CD __eou__ </d> ok i am trying rescue and will reinstall grub __eou__
except mac os x :) __eou__ </d> never used os X so i don't know that XD __eou__ </d> it 's unix and apart from linux it feels finished __eou__ </d> nice ! __eou__ </d> i switched to osx from gentoo __eou__
I am about 2 seconds from exploding help me please __eou__ I do nomodeset and it boots off the live cd __eou__ </d> Is this an nVidia chipset ? __eou__ I would try holding the shift key on boot , see if it can get into recovery console , reinstall the nvidia drivers . Some folks seem to be getting this on certain nvidia GPUs . __eou__ <unk> : It appears to be limited to a handful of nVidia PCI IDs ... from what I have seen . __eou__ </d> right __eou__ would that stop me from getting to grub with shift or esc ? __eou__

not in my opinion __eou__ </d> yea i have bleeding edge hardware , google samsung chronos series 7 __eou__ why do you think that ? __eou__ </d> have to do something special to get it working on 11.10 ? __eou__ I think that because I doubt if a special driver is needed for 12.04 that is different from 11.10 __eou__ </d> in 11.10 it had these issues , in 12.04 they made the laptop almost unusable __eou__ </d> then I'd probably wait ... or try running the LiveCD and playing around to see if I oculd tell if issues would come up or not ( but of course , the LiveCD uses mostly generic drivers __eou__
Oh , man , this is killing me . Will the Ubuntu community hate me if I post this on forums ? There 's nothing on my particular laptop model , and there a million guides that all lead to different things , and I have no idea what to do . For those that do not know , I want to use more graphic power on my Ubuntu 12.04 . I have a GeForce 520M Cuda with an Intel integrated card . __eou__ </d> check out bumblebee __eou__ </d> I read about bumblebee , but at the end of the thread , it said that I don't need it for my Cuda card ( or I misinterpreted the text again) . nitzs : I just want to enable 3D support , I don't need the full power of the cards , switching , and so on . __eou__
I am about 2 seconds from exploding help me please __eou__ I do nomodeset and it boots off the live cd __eou__ </d> chances are you've run into a plymouth bug __eou__ </d> well how do I fix it __eou__ </d> try this : when booting , hit escape until the GRUB menu shows up , then boot recovery mode ( AND WATCH THE MESSAGES ! that 's important ) __eou__ </d> no grub __eou__ </d> if you get the purple screen it means that it already went beyond grub , trust me __eou__ yes , the ISO is probably just fine , there 's a chance you got yourself an unstable version of ubuntu __eou__ please vut that out , i AM trying to help you here __eou__ </d> the final version of 12.04 __eou__ </d> good , like i said , reboot , hit escape until grub shows up , then boot into rescue mode __eou__ </d> sorry its just annoying that an LTS is having this many issues __eou__ I do and it does nothing ive tried trust me __eou__ </d> there are literally billions of reasons that could cause this behaviour , and most of them are because of PEBKAC __eou__
Hi , guys ! So , this is my third time being here today , I've been troubleshooting the whole day . Here 's the deal . I have a Intel/nVidia hybrid card ( I think) . It says GeForce GT520M CUDA on the sticker . Now , the thing is I'm running Unity 2D on 12.04 , but I want to go 3D , and I figure I can't because I can't install the drivers . Can Unity 3D run on the Intel Graphics , or do I need to enable my nVidia card ? __eou__ The Additional drivers is blank . __eou__ </d> have you looked here ? >> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics __eou__ alrighty :) __eou__ </d> I read the entire post and as I get it , they talk about swithing from my Intel card to my nVidia card , right ? __eou__ </d> yes , from what I read . You basically end up choosing one of the two . __eou__ the intel will be the " powersaving " gpu . Nvidia for performance . __eou__
hi __eou__ i need some help .... __eou__ I am try to configure ubuntu /etc/default/grub for text mode login promp .... __eou__ Can anyone help me please ? __eou__ i changed GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT= " text " and it boot in text mode but not text mode login prompt ... __eou__ </d> did you run " sudo update-grub " after making the change ? __eou__ </d> yeah and then i get the text mode boot but not login __eou__ </d> ? " text " worked for me ? __eou__ </d> sorry did not understand you __eou__ </d> i but " text " in my grub and it worked . __eou__ </d> So it prompt you for password in text mode ( like user : password : ) , then " startx " ? __eou__

... __eou__ </d> WINdows Emulator < clever , even if incorrect ;) __eou__ re : pkkid 's ssd i have no idea ... sorry __eou__ fyi you need " lscpi -v " to see multiple cards if it 's hybrid __eou__ if it 's 2 or more inpendent cards the -v isn't required , only for optimus __eou__ with lscpi ? if you have the hardware you'd be the one to know ! but when asked to post lspci pastes , i often see only the intel mentioned ?! __eou__ </d> I have to write detection routines , so I see them just about every day when someone is complaining my code isn't working ... but I have never had an optimus that did not display both . __eou__ </d> interesting , thanks . __eou__ prior to bumblebee ( or other) , does the video get detected differently ? __eou__ </d> We do not use bumblebee , I dedicate the discrete gpu because we are graphics intensive and need accelleration __eou__ </d> both you and ActionParsnip are correct . old versions of apt-get required teh ".. remove -- purge .." - new versions don't __eou__ brightness issue with portables is often an acpi issue __eou__ </d> you are very correct ... I always forget that ... this should probably be addressed with a boot parameter __eou__ </d> i believe nilsma 's error is saying - read only file system , or file __eou__ every DM i know of , runs as root __eou__ i think you have a typo there - should only be one : between username and group __eou__ </d> I just want to get this thing online so we can copy and paste commands and replies ... we will undo it once things are figured out __eou__ </d> thats fine - i just wanted the OP to be aware . __eou__ i don't think update-grub requires a device to be specified __eou__ </d> I just always do it because I have different installs on different drives on my dev box , and depending on what I am doing I may or may not want it to find grub wherever it lies ... designating boot drives in bios . __eou__
<unk> : The problem with those proprietary third party drivers , is that they don't always handle drops well . msttcorefonts is particularly gross about it . __eou__ </d> ah understood , shame that it can affect my whole installation though - maybe there should be a way around individual download problems __eou__ </d> There is . Don't use anything not free ... and by free I do not mean cost . __eou__ </d> well time to restart , hope this works out , thanks for all your help __eou__

will Ubuntu issue an iso for the 12.04 . 1 point release in July ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__ </d> thanks -- will have to burn more CDs in July then ... like August leaves . __eou__ </d> always a good practice to wait to point releases for critical servers __eou__ </d> what about machines of impatient relatives ? __eou__ </d> many kinds of partitioning options are supposed by the installer including manually specifying what to keep and what to go __eou__
is xmonad also a window manager ? __eou__ are compiz and xmonad two different window managers that occupy the same group and are mutually exclusive ? __eou__ </d> yes __eou__ </d> interesting . does compiz itself have any tiling capacity or is it mostly about being pretty ? __eou__ </d> no tiling as far as i know __eou__ </d> am I correct in thinking that unity is actually what makees things pretty but compiz ... is something else ? __eou__
So , 12.04 won't be available for 10.04 until 12.04 . 01 ( from update-manager) . However , will I be able to update from a CD containing the 12.04 iso ? __eou__ </d> they told me there will be an 12.04 . 1 iso . __eou__ </d> hm right , from what I saw somewhere in ubuntu 's website 12.04 . 01 won't be available until august __eou__ guess I'd better go with a fresh install __eou__

any first impressions of the new version ? working ok without problems or have there been snags ? __eou__ wondering if i should upgrade right away or let it settle __eou__ </d> be patient ... or do a clean install , it will minimize the number of pain killers __eou__ </d> i find a lot of times the problem with the upgrades is the cruft in the home dir __eou__ i'd like to see a guide that shows what configs to wipe out so it doesn't mess stuff up __eou__ a lot of times problems seen with your usual login don't exist if you try a new login __eou__ </d> I have read many people messed up with upgrade . __eou__
can we get clarified : is ubuntu- 12.04 <unk> . iso is so-called " LiveCD " which CANNOT be used to upgrade ??? and the " Alternate " iso must be used for upgrading ?? __eou__ </d> you don't need a disk to upgrade __eou__ which version are you on atm ? __eou__ </d> I'm 10.04 -- just burned the CD for ubuntu- 12.04 <unk> . iso -- now wondering if even can be used to upgrade to 12.04 . __eou__ </d> rsvp ... just use " do-release-upgrade " in the terminal inside 10.04 ... you do not need the disk __eou__ the disk is only for a clean install __eou__ </d> are you sure ? and what about the necessity of the -d as in " do-release-upgrade -d " ? __eou__
Hello . Fresh 12.04 install . But I have no sound ! Help me please . __eou__ Btw ubuntu istalling is difficult , so much bugs ... __eou__ I see ^) __eou__ How to setup sound guys ? __eou__ Wanna music . __eou__ </d> you have two sound devices ? __eou__ </d> looks like ubuntu thinks my nvidia video card is soundcard too . __eou__ </d> in command , type this , aplay -- <unk> __eou__ bye . __eou__
how goes the upgrading ? __eou__ </d> Push CTRL+ALT+T __eou__ Lol oops . __eou__ </d> thank you though ! :) __eou__ </d> Worked out fine , except I was doing that on Linuxmint distro . xD , I had issue regarding unity though , I decided to jsut clean install Ubuntu in the end . __eou__ </d> I've been waiting all day to upgrade my computer at work . I'm wondering how long it 's going to take depending on load __eou__
about how long have the desktops been taking to upgrade ? __eou__ </d> depends if you're doing upgrade via online -- on how fast the net is for you , or offline which may be faster __eou__ Maya , upgrading via ssh ( be sure to use the program " screen ", if the ssh closes , screen will remain operating on the machine ) __eou__ </d> I had to read up on screen today , which is why I was hesitant . So basically just ssh to the server then do a screen session and run the upgrade in the screen session ? __eou__ </d> yes , because if you're ssh terminates , apt will get killed __eou__ but if screen is running ( screen is a multiplexer , it'll run bash under it on startup ) __eou__ then screen will remain active , __eou__ </d> will that screen session then also be visible via the monitor attached to the server when I get home __eou__ </d> if ssh closes , you simply re-ssh in and then you always type " screen -RR " << which means ask screen to return to any background running tasks __eou__ </d> ahh I see __eou__ </d> the common helper shortcut in screen is , ' ctl-a ' then '?' for the list of other shortcuts __eou__
unity is a shell on top of gnome3 , compiz is the default window manager of unity __eou__ </d> so gnome3 runs beneath unity ? __eou__ </d> yes , unity is built on top of gnome3 __eou__ in 11.04 is was on top of gnome2 __eou__ </d> hm okay . and so what does unity do with windows that compiz does not , and visa versa ? __eou__ </d> no you misunderstand , unity uses compiz as the window manager , unity is basically what you'd call the desktop environment __eou__ if you were running xfce ( desktop environment ) your window manager would be xfwm4 __eou__ </d> okay so unity relies on compiz to interpret its X window API and render a window ( including all __eou__ </d> yes , and unity2d uses metacity instead of compiz as the window manager __eou__ </d> what 's Unity2D ? a different distribution ? __eou__ </d> no , unity2d is the lesser version of unity , you fall back to unity2d if you can't run full unity ( usually due to the graphics ) __eou__
hey guys I have ubuntu 10.04 and would like to upgrade to 12.04 , how ?? __eou__ </d> " do-release-upgrade " __eou__ </d> but i guess before that I have to update my current 10.04 , correct ? __eou__ </d> yeah .. make sure you're up to date , then use " do-release-upgrade " - you may want to wait as the servers are still being overloaded __eou__ </d> but the main concern is , I am using screen terminal emulator , and will it work with unity ?? __eou__ </d> are you using the server version or the desktop version ..? __eou__ </d> desktop version __eou__ </d> it will update you to unity ... however , you're probably better doing a fresh install ... upgrades are still a rough ride __eou__ </d> I am a programmer and I normally prefer , screen , yeahconsole and vim , vim will surely work but I am not sure of the other two __eou__ </d> they'll all work fine in 12.04 __eou__ if anything is going to go wrong , it'll be your GUI __eou__ </d> a fresh install will not be possible for me as I have lot of data now __eou__ </d> then my advice would be to not upgrade until you've taken a backup __eou__ </d> so , if we consider the worst condition , how can I gain back my GUI ?? __eou__ </d> with a reinstall ... however it is possible that it might all die so I would backup just in case .... <unk> , sorry ... can you post the contents of " sudo fdisk -l " into pastebin ? __eou__ </d> but I have data which is more than 600GB and it is not possible for me to find a spare hard disk __eou__ </d> then I repeat , don't attempt an upgrade __eou__

we're running 10.04 -- why does the Ubuntu engineer recommend waiting until <unk> 's point release for upgrading to 12.04 ??? And will that point release be available as iso to burn to CD ??? __eou__ </d> it 's expected that people still running the last LTS , would want a stable new LTS - thus they need the testing between release and the . 1 release . __eou__ </d> one would think that the alpha , beta , and final would have tested upgrade migration . Everything I have read so far indicates smooth transition -- anyone hear any disaster stories re 12.04 upgrades ??? __eou__

Hi all , anyone knows how to install ' technical ' software like zlib-dev via muon software center ? __eou__ I also would like to install the OpenGL dev files . __eou__ </d> you will almost always have a nicer time installing dev packages from the command line with apt-get : apt-cache search -n mesa dev ; for the opengl libraries , sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev ; for zlib __eou__ </d> yes but I don't always know the package name . __eou__ so it would be handy if I could search in muon software center . __eou__ </d> that is the point , it is easier to find with apt-cache search , it is almost impossible to find in the gui package managers ( even fairly unintuitive in synaptic ) __eou__ </d> well with ubuntu software center it was easy . Just had to enable ' Show Technical Items ' __eou__ but I don't see that option in muon . __eou__ </d> never used muon , so I have no idea , sorry __eou__

I think I'm going to give my ubuntu partition most of the space from the data partition , except for 10GB , which will be useful for moving files between OSes __eou__ and , most other crap like pictures and stuff can go into my external HD __eou__ seems like I can give ubuntu a total of 70GB __eou__ overkill ? __eou__ any one ? __eou__ Going to store all my media on an external __eou__ I wish __eou__ I could give windows more space , but , all my linux partitions are in an extended __eou__ Also , should I make the fat32 an ntfs instead ? linux can read ntfs right ? __eou__ </d> Yes . It can also write to NTFS with the correct package installed . Ubuntu can also read/write FAT32 . I would suggest converting it to NTFS just to make your Windows installation more secure . __eou__ Use NTFS then . You will have to " sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g " to install the package to write to NTFS . __eou__ copy/paste isn't *that* much work . __eou__ </d> I have to right click ! __eou__ </d> At least you aren't using a MAC and have to <unk> .

Dr Willis - I stupidly " removed " Unity 2D and since can't use Ubuntu . I have managed to make a new install on a pendrive , and using that can see some of my old files on the hard drive __eou__ Dr Willis - when I tried to reinstall from the pendrive , I got confused at the partition point __eou__ </d> - can you boot it in rescue mode ? __eou__ - do you have another partition or another blank usb stick that you can copy your files to ? __eou__ - if you can't boot the operating system , your best bet is to run ubuntu ( or another distro ) live and copy the files to another partition or external hdd or usb stick __eou__ - you don't have to delete the data on the " bad " partition any time soon ; take your time . you can mount the windows partion from your live usb stick and copy your data to that __eou__ </d> I had the same problem but by using the pendrivelinux.com programme I had success __eou__

Let me check if it works on current . :) __eou__ </d> have you seen this guide ? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Laptops/Dell/XPS/15z __eou__ </d> yes I followed it last time on 11.10 __eou__ </d> yo , found this article <unk> , not exactly for for 15z but still good info __eou__ ye , but it dont work __eou__ </d> that is a nice article . I will try Bumblebee to see if it rescue me :) __eou__ </d> from what I can tell , wait a few days before you switch to 12.04 full time __eou__ </d> got it , but I already upgraded , and been on windows 7 for last 8 months , I cannt get back :( __eou__ </d> no clonezilla backups ? __eou__
So I guess nobody knows how Ubuntu on a Mac can work . Shame , I've been at this all night ... __eou__ </d> I ran Ubuntu on a Mac once . I wouldn't recommend it , but search for " Mac dual boot " on Google . You have to install a custom loader ( called reFIT ) and stuff like that . __eou__ </d> This isn't my first rodeo with Ubuntu on a Mac . I've done it before , first back in the PPC days , and then with an Intel Mac . I just can't get this one to work , and I've found nobody having the same problem I have . It 's all weird stuff that 's almost the same but not quite . __eou__
a channel ban won't stop him from querying you __eou__ </d> oh i know , i already blocked him in the channel and server level as well . So i wasnt seeing anything after the first offense __eou__ </d> as long it 's a local one .. For future needs : Run removal and adding of that module in a single shell line , in screen - and best restarting your network , too , because it might lose your config __eou__
in 12.04 why can't I find the nautilus option to open with a custom application ? __eou__ </d> rightclick what you want to open __eou__ </d> I mean custom path , eg run with <unk> . sh __eou__
Hi guys , I've tried to update to the latest ubuntu and my system crashed It didn't finish the install and now I can't install/update anythin and when doing apt-get install it gives me this error apt-get : error while loading shared libraries : libapt-pkg . so . 4.12 : cannot open shared object file : No such file or directory __eou__ What can I do to finish the update , or to downgrade , reinstall is not yet an option __eou__ </d> what does apt-get -f install do ? __eou__ </d> 1 moment __eou__
I'm trying to install Ubuntu but the installer keeps crashing on me for some strange reason . It 's already messed with my partitions once and then crashed , I don't want that to happen again . What do I do ? __eou__ </d> You'll need to describe it a bit more ... where is it crashing ? are you seeing an error message ? __eou__ </d> It launches the reporting tool , but doesn't display a useful error . It just says something along the likes of " An error has occured ". But I don't want to risk my partitions again just to send a bug report . __eou__ </d> I would would say back up data and then reinstall using new partitions __eou__ What is the partition setup you are looking to run with ? __eou__ </d> Just the standard one Ubuntu sets up when you use the ' Alongside ' option . __eou__ I'll try again , I guess . And if it fails again , i'll send the report this time . __eou__ </d> Might try Custom and then select the partition you want to install to ? I assume you are looking to dualboot ? __eou__ </d> Indeed . Okay , what partition/part of the HDD should I install the MBR to ? __eou__
What 's the difference between installing the gnome package and the gnome-shell package ? __eou__ </d> it 's looks like gnome-shell is the bit of gnome that directly interacts with the user , while " gnome " is a package that will pull in a good chunk of gnome __eou__ why do you need to know ? __eou__ </d> thanks , was just interested __eou__

the size should only be limited to what space you have left on the windows partition __eou__ </d> I'm fairly certain there was a drop down that limited the size of the partition I could setup __eou__ and I believe the highest option was 30GB __eou__ </d> oh , sorry __eou__ </d> maybe he forgot his password ? :-) __eou__

Hey everyone . Does anybody have any experience with SSH ? __eou__ I need help with that . __eou__ and I can't download it using wget __eou__ Ok . Nothing actually but it needs a log on to a website . Each time you try to download the file , it gives a new ID number . I am connecting to another server using PuTTY . I don't have __eou__ VNC access to otherwise access it . __eou__ So , is it possible to download files with variable download IDs using putty when SSHing to another server without VNC access ? __eou__ It 's http , not ftp by the way . __eou__ </d> - what do you mean - http and ssh are completely separate __eou__ - can you get the file in a browser ? __eou__ </d> absolutely __eou__ </d> could it be write permission in the directory you're running wget in ? __eou__ - can you put your wget command up somwhere __eou__
Ok . Nothing actually but it needs a log on to a website . Each time you try to download the file , it gives a new ID number . I am connecting to another server using PuTTY .

I am trying to use that std0s __eou__ I am trying to use wget to download a file onto the server . __eou__ Ok . Let me give you an example . Filename . avi ? <unk> . That number changes each time I try to download via a regular browser _xan_ . __eou__ So , it 's possible in putty to specify login and then download the file ? __eou__ but I don't want to get it through my browser __eou__ I want to download it on my server . __eou__ </d> in general a scheme like that is because the website wants you to use a browser ... and won't let you get it without one __eou__ why not download the file on our own system and then copy it to the destination ? __eou__ </d> my upload speed is really slow __eou__ </d> it 's not trivial ... (almost ) everything is possible __eou__ try it in links2 ( a text based web browser ) __eou__ if it 's alerady installed , yes . Umm , if it 's " your " server then why not ? __eou__ yeah , that 's to make sure you only download it from a web broswer that you've signed in on . I doubt you'll be able to get the file with wget __eou__ put the url in "", it will give you the file ( in this one particular case ) __eou__ not on a server install no ... a GUI browser would be unusual __eou__

If I reinstall the latest version of Ubuntu ( I find that reinstalling is generally safer than upgrading ) is there any way to specify that Ubuntu use gnome as my window interface instead of unity when installing ? __eou__ </d> lightdm rembers your last selection .. so its not that big a deal __eou__ ! info fish __eou__ </d> If I upgrade , I find it 's generally better to install a fresh version without reformatting the drive ( so I can keep my files ) rather than " upgrading " __eou__

Would a removal/reinstallation of Compiz && CCSM be detrimental to my system , or would it revert back to " stock "? __eou__ ( via command-line , that is ) __eou__ </d> it wouldnt go back to stock - unless thats the only change you made __eou__ </d> I just mean as far as Compiz settings goes . If I " sudo apt-get purge compiz && ccsm ", then " sudo apt-get install compiz " would all compiz settings go back to ' stock ' settings ? ( I *may* have borked something in CCSM to where windows and pop-up menus refuse to reveal themselves to me ) __eou__

You can do : remove libvdpau1 , or force hardware acceleration and accept a little instability of flash .

Since /usr/share/themes , of course , isn't in your home directory , my theme got inheritently erased when I installed Ubuntu . __eou__ so it resorted to a fallback theme , which of course , looks terrible . __eou__ one sec . there 's a small GUI to install to change it , let me check __eou__ gnome-tweak-tool __eou__ </d> so I googled around and installed that __eou__ </d> fire it up . It 's likely listed as Advanced Settings or some crap in your menu . __eou__ Shell theme is for Gnome Shell . __eou__ you want to look for GTK+ theme and Window theme . __eou__ it 's under the same menu , just further down . __eou__ GTK+ themes take over immediately . Window themes only take over when you log out/back in . But the bulk of what you need is GTK+ themes . __eou__ your GTK theme is the awful looking thing you see now . Choosing a new GTK theme should , hopefully , make it look not so suck . But yes , open a new window and see . __eou__ </d> ok , brb __eou__ reboot didn't even fix it - despite changing the themes it isn't changing anything ( tried w/ normal and gksu ) __eou__ </d> what theme is currently in use ? __eou__ </d> Ambiance - but I tried changing it to multiple other things with no effect __eou__ would erasing . gconf fix it ? __eou__ </d> open a terminal . cd to /usr/share/themes . then run ls -l ( thats LS -L , but run it lowercase) . Pastebin the output . __eou__ I said that assuming you knew terminal commands . If you need a bit more detail let me know . __eou__
I think ubuntu 12.04 LTS is just a little different from 11.10 __eou__ </d> little ? I'm finding it to be quite a lot different . I've passionately hated Unity since the day it came out , and for the first time not only can I tolerate it , but I enjoy it . __eou__ </d> what do I want to say is 12.04 is more good-looking than 11.10 __eou__ </d> I'm not sure ? What do you want to say ? __eou__ updates are a good thing . It means things are getting fixed . :) __eou__
what is the status of power dissipation bug in 12.04 LTS ? I use lenovo __eou__ can anyone help me on it __eou__ </d> is it a clean install ? __eou__ </d> yeah __eou__ </d> maybe its just the battery applet , try a different battery monitor app __eou__
anyone else have some games not working ? __eou__ why wont my paid for application work ? __eou__ </d> steam ? __eou__ </d> Ubuntu __eou__ the store __eou__
Is it a mistake to run ' do-release-upgrade ' in GUI desktop ? __eou__ </d> probably that would be fine __eou__ I usually do my upgrades from within the GUI __eou__ </d> I only asked for an English install , but Language Support also shows 2 chinese locales installed . Is this normal ? __eou__ </d> You should probably pick one of the Chinese options __eou__ that'll be more fun ! :) __eou__ </d> I start Language Support , under Install/remove languages on English is selected , but there 's also a Chinese line at the end of list on Language tab . Is this normal ? __eou__ </d> I don't know if it is normal . But I'd personally not worry about it . __eou__
hey- when 's this ubuntu officially out of beta ? __eou__ ah __eou__ neato __eou__ there 's not much fanfare nowadays .. __eou__ </d> fanfare ? __eou__ the lack of speed with their main updatet server would suggest they're getting pwned right now . __eou__ especially considering new ones are added with each release , and even still they're swamped under demand of the bandwidth to get 12.04 . __eou__ </d> the themes ? __eou__
I'm trying to upgrade an Ubuntu server from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS __eou__ however , 12.04 isn't coming up as an option __eou__ am I being silly here ? __eou__ </d> one second . __eou__ </d> do-release-upgrade has prompted me to upgrade to maverick __eou__ I don't mind stepping through them one at a time , just wanna make sure I'm not missing something . __eou__ thanks folks __eou__
hey there , is there a way to change a icon on the unity launcher ? __eou__ </d> have you tried myunity its in ubuntu software center __eou__ </d> ive tried myunity i can change the icon size , but not the icon itself __eou__
I'm trying to upgrade an Ubuntu server from 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS __eou__ however , 12.04 isn't coming up as an option __eou__ am I being silly here ? __eou__ do-release-upgrade has prompted me to upgrade to maverick __eou__ I don't mind stepping through them one at a time , just wanna make sure I'm not missing something . __eou__ </d> 10.04 won't offer an upgrade to 12.04 untill 12.04 . 1 exists ( see the <unk> . If you want to upgrade , you must pass -d I believe __eou__ </d> is there something wrong with 12.04 that would be a good reason to note upgrade yet ? __eou__ </d> see releasenotes , bug tracker , and this channel :) ( I don't know ; it 's probably fine ) __eou__ </d> reading the release notes atm __eou__
autoclean only gets rid of packages that are basically useless , not being available for dl . It trims the cache without fully ridding it . __eou__ what do you mean ? All that clean/autoclean do is remove all/some packages from /var/cache/apt/archives autoremove gets rid of packages that were installed as dependencies but are not needed . __eou__ if you are without desktop , then use text ... but server can run desktop as well . __eou__ I am very fond of clonezilla __eou__ </d> I have learn about Clonezilla , but i think it is a little difficult . __eou__ </d> It is very simple ... but it can seem confusing because of the number of options you have available with regards to whole disk/partition backup to whatever location you want . What are you trying to back up to ? __eou__ </d> I have installed the whole Ubuntu in the /dev/sda6 , i want to backup it . __eou__
I just did a fresh install of 12.04 LTS and all went ok however after updating packages the system hangs on boot . Anyone else experiencing this ? __eou__ </d> any output what went wrong ? __eou__ does alt-ctrl-f1 work ? __eou__ </d> everything update correctly .. I did however notice it hangs after Apparmor starts . __eou__ I did not try however I was able to get down to root shell by using recovery mode . __eou__ </d> ok , but this will not help solving the problem __eou__ </d> what should I do in order to solve it ? __eou__ </d> you should try boot again in normal mode and try to get a shell , if you are not able to get a shell , then I would try disabling appamor __eou__ in recovery mode __eou__ </d> hmm , but there 's an [ OK ] thingie after the apparmor entry in the boot process .. it just hangs after that . I don't think it 's Apparmor . __eou__ </d> ok , i see ... did you wait for a while ? __eou__ did you have internet connectivity ? __eou__ </d> for about 30 minutes . The HDD led was blinking from time to time . __eou__ it did get past the network initialization I think . __eou__
anyone else have some games not working ? __eou__ why wont my paid for application work ? __eou__ the store __eou__ </d> does the game use steam __eou__ </d> ubunut software center __eou__ no its a linux game __eou__ </d> yeah I saw that after I hit enter __eou__ </d> you buy it on the software center __eou__ aha __eou__ I installed it it puts an icon on the bar I click it , it flashes for a second and doesnt start __eou__ couple applications are doing this with 12.04 __eou__ I may go back a version __eou__ to 11.10 __eou__ </d> your gpu nvidia by chance ? __eou__ </d> with drivers __eou__ so yeah __eou__ lots of other things seemingly work without much of an issue just a couple applications dont start at all __eou__
Are there any logs which show when applications started and closed ? __eou__ </d> no , but you can use auditing capabilities of the kernel , see package system-config-audit __eou__ </d> thanks :) __eou__
gtk widgets ? __eou__ </d> i wish i had stayed 11.10 also __eou__ </d> not me . 11.10 wasn't bad at all , but 12.04 leaves me with 0 desire to use 11.10 . __eou__

Thanks ! __eou__ Sorry , I found the command and run succesfully . I think it deleted something , but after reboot lightdm starts again . __eou__ </d> that command will not delete anything , just remove all instances of the script from runlevels __eou__ </d> I thought from the message : " Removing any system startup links ". But lightdm service starts again after reboot . Is there a way to disable it ? __eou__ </d> cp /etc/X11/default-display-manager <unk> . bu ; echo " /bin/false " > /etc/X11/default-display-manager __eou__

I'm on ATI this time around , and on 12.04 I can't change my resolution to my laptop 's native res __eou__ well to be fair , it 's not like there are ' ubuntu drivers ' __eou__ it 's all whatever the kernel supports __eou__ I just think there needs to be more money put into QA somehow __eou__ I know I'd be willing to pay for ubuntu . __eou__ ha __eou__ speaking of actual help however , I need some help now that I'm running 12.04 to get my ati drivers working again . __eou__ I was running pretty well with the open source drivers in 11.10 __eou__ I think they just try to make sure most things work on the really popular hardware , and leave everyone else to fend for themselves __eou__ which is totally fair , in all honesty __eou__ </d> does lspci | grep VGA | grep -Ei ' (( <unk> ? <unk> ) ' return a result ? __eou__ </d> No , it does not . __eou__ I have a mobility firepro M8900 __eou__ </d> apt-get -s remove fglrx* __eou__ </d> No fglrx packages installed __eou__ just did that ..

I tested on my mp3 player and they are ok . Also , the audio board is OK , as I was using it on Xubuntu 11.10 without any problem __eou__ </d> Yeah new releases having lots of bugs is pretty common in my past use . __eou__ </d> I don't know if this is a coincidence , but when I used Fedora 16 , on a specif kernel version my audio worked , but on more recent versions , it behaved just like Ubuntu is doing right now __eou__ *Maybe* it is an upstream issue ? __eou__ </d> DId you check for mutes etc ? __eou__ </d> Yep __eou__ </d> Is it a PCI card or onboard ? __eou__ </d> Onboard __eou__ </d> I would google like mad for a solution for sure . __eou__ Little stuff like that made me quit using Ubuntu as my main OS . __eou__ I hear ya . __eou__ Any idea what chipset ? __eou__

anyone know any good C development environments that support sftp natively ? __eou__ right now I'm using notepad++ via wine but that has its own problems __eou__ </d> why not use sshfs instead ? __eou__ </d> because of the overhead of setup and teardown __eou__ </d> can't say I noticed it much ... you mount it and then forget about it . I don't know of an IDE that can do scp natively . However , that doesn't mean there isn't one ( try looking for at eclipse ... there are eclipse plugins for pretty much everything ) __eou__ </d> I do development on a number of different machines so it would be nice to be able to choose them from a list rather than mounting the appropriate machine __eou__ </d> and emacs can certainly do it ( so vim probably can too) . They're more editors than full IDEs though ( the line is blurred somewhat with emacs ) __eou__ </d> editor is fine , I'm not going to be compiling and debugging through it __eou__

Hi ... when trying to update to 12.04 from 11.10 , I get the message " It was not possible to calculate the update ". How should I proceed to upload ? __eou__ </d> is it network failure ? __eou__ </d> nope :( __eou__ </d> re-launch your update manager may help , it should be dependency problem __eou__ i mean the package list downloaded maybe in-complete .. __eou__ </d> I tried that ... next step is purging all ppas __eou__ </d> take a look here http://markmail.org/thread/fgo5e7hl6qanvk2f , do you have any error message ? __eou__ ppas are disabled during update .. IIRC __eou__ </d> my issue is quite similar to the one this guy had __eou__ </d> any error message ? there might be some " icon " you can click on , that shows the details __eou__ </d> I'll rerun to see the error again ... it takes a while to get to that stage , just a min __eou__ http://i.imgur.com/G5dHa.png __eou__ the same issue the guy reported on the mail list you showed me __eou__ </d> can you translate the line started with " E :" ? __eou__ </d> It is impossible to correct the problems , you kept on hold broken packages . __eou__ should I just fresh install 12.04 ? :-/ __eou__ </d> sorry i can't help you then .. maybe you can try laterly , in a few days , or report a bug to ubuntu __eou__ burn a desktop CD is the easiest __eou__

also run a memory test ( such as memtest86+) __eou__ </d> I've done the memtest , no issues I could see __eou__ </d> sadly there are very few OSS BIOSes really . __eou__
in that case , check if your GPU is properly seated . __eou__ </d> I've reseated it . I don't seem to have an onboard one .. so I'll need to borrow a firends to rule it out . any software tests I can run ? __eou__ </d> well the issues you are describing are definitely hardware issues . __eou__ the suggestion made by tomreyn is a good one , a ramtest does take a few hours though . __eou__
hello , I just installed 12.04 and name my computer wrong . I tried changing the hostname but the " device name " under the details tab in system settings doesn't seem to be changing . Anyone know how to change the " device name " __eou__ </d> careful changing your computer name !!! __eou__ </d> Thanks for the heads up . Just changed the /etc/hosts file as well as the /etc/hostname file . I have a feeling though that ubuntu applications are using this " device name " setting . Any idea how to change this ? __eou__ </d> no clue sorry ( i'm not even sure what that is ) __eou__ </d> if you go to your system settings -- > details option ... it will show up __eou__

Is it possibe that some SSD drives are just not compatible with Ubuntu 12.04 ? __eou__ </d> yes , but unlikely __eou__ </d> I thinkp its very likey then . Lol . I tried installing 32bit , 64bit on my SSD with all sorts of different bios settings and nothing works . The boot loader just wont install .
